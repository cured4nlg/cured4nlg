For the week ending 16 August, over 1.8 million new COVID-19 cases and 39000 new deaths were reported to WHO. This brings the cumulative total to 21.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases including 761000 deaths (Figure 1). In the past seven days, the number of reported daily cases rapidly increased with an average of 260000 cases and 5500 deaths. The WHO Region of the Americas remains the most affected region in the past seven days, accounting for 53% of all newly confirmed cases and 75% of reported deaths. The South-East Asia Region continues to report an increase in cases and is currently the second most affected region. While the number of cases decreased in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from the end of June through to 10 August, a 10% increase was reported in the number of cases reported in last seven days. The number of reported deaths, however, have continued to decrease across the region. The Western Pacific Region reported a large increase in the number of deaths compared to the previous seven days, although, this accounted for just 1% of the new deaths reported globally. The African Region reported a decrease in the number of cases and deaths over the past seven days (Table 1, Figure 2). Due to the resurgence of cases in many countries, stay at home measures and travel restrictions are being re-implemented as part of efforts to limit the transmission of the virus.
The African Region reported the largest decrease in the number of newly reported cases (27%) and deaths (21%) in the past seven days, primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in South Africa, Kenya, Algeria, Nigeria and Ghana. Conversely, Ethiopia reported a 56% and 12% increase in the number of cases and deaths respectively, with more than half of the cases reported in Addis Ababa. Due to the increase in cases, a month-long testing and prevention campaign will be implemented with a plan to carry out 400000 tests. There are increasing reports of healthcare worker infections across the region, resulting in an overburdened health care system in several countries including Gambia, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.
In the WHO Region of the Americas, the number of cases reported last week remained stable compared to the previous week, with a less than 1% increase in the number of newly confirmed cases. However, during the same period, the number of deaths increased by 13%. The United States of America reported 360000 new cases, a 4% decrease from the previous week. This decrease may in part be attributed to an underreporting of cases in California due to technology issues with the electronic laboratory reporting systems which reports into the state's disease registry system. The number of deaths reported in Peru increased by 220% in the past seven days to a total of 25800 and a cumulative death rate of 784 deaths per 1 million population, which is currently the highest in the region. Reports of COVID-19 cases among indigenous people are increasing across the region, with a reported mortality rate higher in this group compared to non-indigenous peoples.
Following five weeks of decline in the number of cases reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, a total of 88700 new cases were reported in the last seven days, a 10% increase in the number of newly reported cases compared to the previous week. While countries in the Gulf state are reporting a decline in incidence, Iraq, Morocco, occupied Palestinian territory, Lebanon and Libya are reporting an increase in cases. The number of cases and deaths reported in Pakistan in the past seven days decreased by 20% and 24% respectively from the previous week, resulting in the lifting of lockdown restrictions across the country.
The number of cases reported in the European Region has gradually increased in recent weeks, however, there was no substantial change in the number of cases reported this week compared to the previous week. Nevertheless, a number of countries in the region are showing a resurgence in cases including France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. Several COVID-19 clusters, which have contributed to the resurgence of cases, have been reported in meat processing and packaging facilities in a number of countries including Belgium, Denmark and Germany. A total of 2480 deaths were reported across the region in the past seven days, which is a 21% decrease from the previous week. However, following a retrospective review process in the United Kingdom, over 5000 deaths were deducted from the country’s total COVID-19 deaths, resulting in a decrease of 2728 deaths in the European region.
South-East Asia is the second most affected region and currently accounts for a respective 26% and 19% of newly reported cases and deaths globally in the past seven days. The region has seen a steady increase in reported cases and deaths, with a 9% increase in the past 7 days, compared to the previous week. India continues to report the majority of cases, accounting for 85% of all confirmed cases in the region as of 16 August and 92% of cases in the past seven days. The Maldives has recorded the highest incidence rate globally as cases continue to increase in the country.
The number of cases reported in the Western Pacific Region decreased by 5% as the number of new cases reported in Japan, Australia, Singapore and Viet Nam decreased in the past seven days. However, the number of deaths reported increased by 90% mainly due to increases reported in the Philippines, Japan, Viet Nam, China and Australia. The Republic of Korea continues to report cases associated with religious clusters and reported an increase of 210% in the number of cases compared to last week. On August 11, New Zealand reported a new locally acquired case, after recording 102 days with no community transmission. A total of 52 new cases have been reported in the past seven days resulting in a temporary lockdown of the northern part of the country. New Zealand is the third country in the region to report a resurgence in cases after a period of little or no known community transmission. Other countries include Australia and Viet Nam.
Over 1.7 million new COVID-19 cases and 39000 new deaths were reported to WHO for the week ending 23 August, a 5% decrease in the number of cases and 12% decrease in the number of deaths compared to the previous week (10 to 16 August) (Figure 1). A cumulative total of over 23 million cases and 800000 deaths have been reported so far. With the exception of the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, a decrease in the weekly case incidence was reported across WHO regions in the last seven days (Table 1, Figure 2). Although the WHO Region of the Americas remains the most affected, accounting for 50% of newly reported cases and 62% of deaths, the region had the largest decrease compared to the previous week. The South-East Asia Region, which is the second most active region, continues to report an increase accounting for 28% and 19% of newly reported cases and deaths respectively. In the European Region, the number of cases reported has consistently increased over the last three weeks, however, a slight decrease (1%) was reported in the most recent week, and the number of deaths have continued to decrease across the region. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the number of reported cases increased by 4% compared to the previous week, however, the number of reported deaths have consistently decreased over the last six weeks. Likewise, the African and Western Pacific regions reported overall decreases in case activity over the past week.
The number of cases and deaths reported in the African Region decreased by 8% and 11% respectively in the past seven days, primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in Algeria, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and South Africa (Figure 3, Table 2). Despite the overall decrease in the number of cases across the region, Uganda reported an increase of over 300%. Here, intensive community transmission has been reported in capital Kampala, particularly the divisions of Makindye, Nakawa and Kawempe. Ethiopia has continued to report an increase in cases and deaths; and similarly, Namibia and Nigeria reported a 55% and 19% increase in the number of cases respectively. After 22 days of no cases, Mauritius reported two new cases in returnees who were repatriated from a neighbouring country.
The number of new cases and deaths decreased by 11% and 17% respectively compared to the previous week – primarily driven by reduced transmission rates reported from Brazil, Dominican Republic, Panama and the United States of America (Figure 4, Table 3). Several countries and territories in the Caribbean islands have, however, reported a large increase in cases and deaths in the last seven days including Bahamas, Guadeloupe, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. The increase in cases observed in the Caribbean islands may in part be due to an increase in tourism. The number of deaths reported in Peru decreased by 73% compared to the previous week, however, the incidence death rate in the last seven days (42 deaths per 1 million population) and the cumulative death rate in the country (826 deaths per 1 million population) remains the highest in the region.
The number of cases reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region increased by 4% in the last seven days, however, the number of deaths decreased by 5% and has consistently decreased over the last six weeks (Figure 5). Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia reported the highest increase in cases compared to the previous week (Table 4). Following the explosion in Beirut, Lebanon on 4 August, health care capacity in the area has diminished while COVID-19 cases continue to rise. As a result of the increase in cases, the Ministry of Public Health has established testing sites for residents and volunteers in the areas most affected by the blast. In addition, several health facilities are being restored and health supplies, including personal protective equipments, have been received.
Following a steady increase in the number of cases reported in the European Region over the last few weeks, the number of cases decreased slightly by 1% in the last seven days. The number of deaths reported in the last seven days decreased by 12%, continuing the downward trend (Figure 6). Not all countries are reporting a decline: Spain reported a 200% increase in the number of deaths in the last week compared to the previous week. As countries across the region continue to report a resurgence in cases, several countries reported record high numbers in the last seven days including Croatia, Czechia, Poland, Republic of Moldova and Ukraine (Table 5). In response to the increase in cases across the region, many countries have recently re-introduced public health and social measures including travel restrictions.
South-East Asia is the second most affected region and currently accounts for 28% and 19% of newly reported cases and deaths respectively, globally in the past seven days. The region has seen a steady increase in reported cases and deaths, with a 4% increase in the past seven days (Figure 7). India continues to report the majority of cases, and has reported a cumulative total of over three million cases, which accounts for 86% of all regional confirmed cases (Table 6). The number of cases and deaths in Nepal has rapidly increased in the last seven days with a 49% and 52% increase respectively compared to the previous weeks. In addition, the testing capacity in Nepal has significantly increased resulting in a 38% increase in the testing rate.
The number of cases reported in the Western Pacific Region decreased by 5% following a decrease in the number of new cases reported by Australia, China, Japan, Singapore and Viet Nam (Figure 8, Table 7). The Republic of Korea reported a 180% increase in cases, mainly due to an increase in cases associated with religious gatherings. Due to the increase in cases reported in the region, some Pacific Island countries are tightening border measures. There is also an increase in active testing and case finding systems across the region, which are facilitating the detection and control of clusters.
Over 1.8 million new COVID-19 cases and 38000 new deaths were reported to WHO in the week ending 30 August, a 1% increase in the number of cases and 3% decrease in the number of deaths compared to the previous week (17 to 23 August) (Figure 1). A cumulative total of nearly 25 million cases and 800000 deaths have been reported since the start of the outbreak. Overall, the Region of the Americas continues to carry the highest burden of COVID-19 globally, accounting for nearly half of all new cases reported in the past seven days, although within the region there have been slight decreases in new cases and deaths in the past week. The WHO South East Asia Region showed the highest rise in new cases in the past week, with over 500,000 new cases reported. In the European Region, new cases and new deaths have continued to increase over the past seven days compared to the previous week. Along with the Region of the Americas, the percentage change in new cases in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific Regions have all declined compared with last week.
Several countries in the Region that were previous COVID-19 hotspots have recorded a reduction in case incidence including Ghana, Kenya, Gabon and Madagascar. While the observed declining trends are encouraging, the figures should be interpreted cautiously as they may be affected by many factors, including the current testing capacity and strategy, and delays in reporting. Cases in Ethiopia have continued to rise, reaching new highs this week (10621 cases) with Addis Ababa remaining the worst affected region. In response, the Ethiopian government, with support from WHO, have launched the COVID-19 Enhanced Community Based Activities and Testing Campaign (ComBAT). ComBAT aims to reach out to over 60 million individuals in a variety of settings, conduct 200000 tests and treat 10000 cases. At 622551 cases, South Africa has the fifth highest number of COVID-19 infections globally and the highest number in Africa. However, there has been a marked decline in new cases since they peaked on 25 July at 13944 cases, and the downward trend has continued this week with new cases falling by 34% (Figure 3). As a result, the government has eased public health and social measures while reminding the public to remain vigilant.
The Americas account for approximately 13% of the world’s population, but over 50% of officially reported global cases and deaths. Currently, while the biggest drivers of the case counts in the region have observed a moderate decline or stabalisation of case incidence (Figure 4), increasing trends are now being seen in other parts of the region including Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina. Social gatherings could also have contributed to the increase in cases in the region. WHO recommends avoiding the ‘three c’s’-crowded places, close contact settings, and confined and enclosed settings. More advice from WHO on how to protect yourself and others from the spread COVID-19 can be found here. The United States of America has the highest number of cases in the world – over 5.8 million cases, a quarter of the global total. However, the country has witnessed a decline in new cases from previous peaks in July of over 70000 cases per day to an average of 41000 new cases per day this past week. As school and university campuses have reopened, there have been news reports of students testing positive. WHO has published guidance for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19. Although cases in Colombia have declined in the past week, they have been gradually increasing since June and continued caution is required. After five months of implementing public health and social measures, Colombia will begin easing the measures beginning 1 September. Argentina has reported new peaks in the number of cases cases reported weekly and an upward trajectory in cases and deaths since June. Cases in Mexico declined by 6% in the past week and have declined gradually across the month of August. Mexico is implementing remote teaching and education for children to reduce transmission.
The Eastern Mediterranean Region has observed a fluctuating incidence of new cases in recent weeks (Figure 5). The highest number of new cases have been seen in Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait. WHO, in partnership with the Iraq Ministry of Health and its implementing partners, has concluded another round of a COVID-19 awareness-raising campaign that intensified community outreach efforts to educate people on measures to limit transmission of COVID-19. The campaign reached more than 5 million people in four densely populated and heavily affected areas in Basra, Wasit, Thi Qar and Missan. Campaign teams are moving to the Kurdistan region and will be targeting 9 heavily populated, high-risk areas in Sulaymaniyah province. Over the past week WHO has also delivered 6 ambulances to the Ministry of Health of the Kurdistan region and 22 tonnes of COVID-19 equipment. In Pakistan, cases have fallen from over 5000 per day in mid-June to 2871 cases in the past week. As the public health and social measures are lifted, the public is encouraged to take precautions to ensure a resurgence does not occur particularly as they celebrate the first 10 days of the month of Muharram, which started on 21 August.
Gradual increases continue to be observed in the European Region (Figure 6), with Spain, Russia, France, and Ukraine reporting the highest number of new cases this week. Spain has seen a resurgence since mid-July and cases are now reaching the peaks previously seen in March and April. July and August is the holiday season in Spain, and social interactions have likely contributed to the increased number of reported cases. Spain has deployed the military to support contact tracing activities. France has also seen a growing number of cases since the end of July with cases rising from around 500 cases per day to approximately 4773 cases per day over the past week. Cases in Italy have shown a marked increase in the past seven days, up by 85% overall compared to last week. In the European Region many of those of who died of COVID-19 have been elderly people (as of this week 88% of all deaths were in persons aged 65 years and over). WHO has published comprehensive guidance on preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services.
South-East Asia has reported the largest week-on-week increase (Figure 7), largely due to increased case detections in India. India has reported nearly 500000 new cases in the past seven days, a 9% increase compared to the previous seven days and the highest numbers of new cases globally. While these trends are concerning, the increase in cases should be seen against a substantive rise in testing in recent weeks. In Indonesia, cases have been gradually increasing while there are also concerns about transmission among family members of school children as 40% of people aged 60 years and older in Indonesia live in three-generation households, meaning that they live with their children and grandchildren. WHO has published interim guidance on considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of COVID-19 and a joint document with UNICEF and IFRC on key messages and actions for COVID-19 prevention and control in schools. WHO has also convened a technical advisory group on schools.
The Philippines and Japan are reporting the highest number of new cases in the region this week although cases in Japan have been decreasing since the end of June with a 22% decrease in overall cases reported this week compared to last week. In the Philippines, a large percentage of cases have been reported from the National Capital Region.
Cumulatively, nearly 27 million COVID-19 cases and 900000 deaths have been reported to WHO to date. Over 1.8 million new cases and 37000 new deaths were reported for the week ending 6 September, a 5% increase in the number of cases and a 2% decrease in the number of deaths compared to the previous week (24 to 30 August) (Figure 1). The WHO South-East Asia Region continued to show the highest increase in new COVID-19 cases in the past week, compared to the previous week, with over 600000 new cases reported. A weekly increase in the number of new reported cases was seen in the European and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, while the African and Western Pacific Regions declined in both cases and deaths compared with last week. The Region of the Americas has seen a 1% increase in reported cases, but a 4% decrease in deaths, and continues to carry the highest burden of the disease globally, accounting for nearly half of all new cases reported in the past seven days.
While cases in South Africa have declined this week, the country continues to report the highest number of cases in the region, accounting for 37% of all new cases. Other countries reporting a high number of cases include Ethiopia, Algeria, Namibia and Kenya. While cases in Nigeria have declined by 35% this week, compared to the previous week, the number of reported deaths increased by 200%.
The United States of America and Brazil account for nearly three quarters of all COVID-19 cases in the Americas. Argentina, Colombia, and Peru account for the next largest proportion in new cases in the region. In the Bahamas, public health and social measures have been extended from mid-August as the island continues to experience an increase in cases (18%) and deaths (15%).
The highest numbers of new cases in the region have been seen in Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Iraq continues to report the highest number of new COVID-19 cases. In Afghanistan, cases have increased by 77% this week compared to last week, although new deaths are down by 33% as compared to last week. In Bahrain, cases have increased by nearly 44% in the past seven days as have cases in Tunisia where trends show an increase in cases since the country reopened its borders at the end of June.
In the European Region, France reported the highest number of new cases in the past seven days with nearly 44000 cases followed closely by Spain at just over 40000. Russia and Ukraine also continue to report a high number of cases. In Ukraine, cases are continuing to rise, with a 19% increase in the past seven days. The government has extended the public health and social measures until the end of October. While cases in Italy have continued to show an increase, this week's 9% increase was substantially lower than last week's nearly 85% increase.
India continues to report a very high number of new cases, reaching nearly 600000 new cases in the past seven days, with an average of approximately 81582 cases per day, the highest numbers of daily new cases in the past week. In Myanmar, cases have shown a marked increase of nearly 87% in the past seven days.
The three countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the Western Pacific Region are the Philippines, Japan and Republic of Korea. However, the Philippines have seen a decrease in new cases in the past week compared to the previous week. French Polynesia has seen an increase of just over 29% in cases in the past seven days; while stricter containment rules were imposed last month, both the government and the French High Commission ruled out more stringent public health and social measures, with schools set to reopen on 7 September.
In the week from 7 through 13 September, there were over 1.8 million new cases of COVID-19, comparable to the previous seven days (Table 1); while deaths increased slightly as compared to the previous week, with over 40600 deaths reported. The Region of the Americas has consistently registered the greatest number of reported cases for many weeks. It continues to account for nearly half of the global total of cases even as cases have declined in the reporting week. The African Region also showed a decline in reported cases this week and was the only region to report a decline in deaths. The European region reported the third-highest number of new cases, amounting to 16% of the global total, and is the region with the second-highest cumulative number of cases per million population (5172 cases per million population).
The African Region has witnessed declining trends in the number of new cases reported (a 14% decrease in cases and a 15% decrease in deaths in the past seven days), with 26 of the 47 affected countries reporting decreases in the past week. While this is encouraging, vigilance is still essential as many factors may be influencing these trends such as testing capacity and strategy, along with delays in reporting in some areas. While South Africa continues to account for the greatest number of cumulative reported cases in the region (Table 2), disease incidence by 1 million population is highest in Mayotte (12367 per million). Cumulative deaths per million population remains the highest in South Africa (260 per million population). Elsewhere in the region, WHO has donated life-saving equipment and medical supplies and helped established a new WHO-supported COVID-19 testing molecular laboratory in Makeni City, northern Sierra Leone, to facilitate scaling up of testing capacity for the disease in the country. Sierra Leone has continued to report COVID-19 cases throughout the pandemic amidst other ongoing communicable diseases outbreaks. Sierre Leone reported 53 cases and 1 death this week, resulting in a cumulative total of 263 cases per million population and 9 deaths per million population.
As cases in the Region of the Americas continues to rise and social dynamics change, the WHO Regional Office has compiled infographics covering a range of issues related to COVID-19, including tips on how to stay safe and healthy during the pandemic for different ages, risk groups and settings. While the numbers are relatively low (Table 2) as compared to other countries in the region, Guadeloupe has reported its highest number of cases this week, rising from 428 new cases in the previous weekly update to 1717 new cases this week, and the transmission pattern has now moved from clusters of cases to community transmission. Cumulative cases and deaths have increased relative to the territory’s population, over 100% in cases (3406 to 7698 per million population) and a 20% increase in cumulative deaths (50 to 60 per million population) in the past seven days. In the past week, Curaçao has shown the highest weekly increase in the number of cases since the start of the outbreak in the country, a 250% increase in weekly new cases reported which translates to a 73% increase in cumulative cases from 475 to 823 per million population. While cases reported this week in Costa Rica are in line with the average for the country in the past few weeks, the number of deaths reported has increased by 84% and a 24% in the incidence of deaths relative to the country’s population (92 to 114 per million population) in the past week.
Cases in the Region continue to rise, an increase of 14% in the past seven days, and currently account for 6% of global cases. Seasonal religious and cultural mass gatherings, wedding celebrations and other social events have contributed to the upsurge of cases in different countries in the region. Upticks of cases reported in Tunisia and Jordan have been linked to ceremonies and celebrations. Cases in Morocco have reached a peak at approximately 2000 per day, an increase of 41% in weekly new cases, resulting in 2288 cases per million population. The majority of new cases (42%) are being reported in the Casablanca-Settat region, where public health and safety measures are being scaled up in response. In Jordan, the number of weekly new cases has increased by 54%, increasing the cumulative cases per million population from 231 to 300. Deaths have remained stable at 2 per million population. Additionally, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in a refugee camp hosting Syrian refugees. In Libya, the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 has more than doubled over the past two weeks; both the cumulative cases and deaths per million population in Libya has increased by 30% in the past seven days. Given the acute shortages of tests and laboratory capacity, the real number of cases is likely to be much higher. WHO is supporting the efforts of Libyan authorities to increase the number of COVID-19 tests and trace all contacts.
The European Region accounts for 16% of global COVID-19 cases and 25% of the deaths. While France reported the highest number of new cases in the past seven days, the top three countries in the region reporting the highest cumulative cases per million population are San Marino (21834 cases per million population), Andorra (17395 per million population) and Israel (16430 per million population). The countries reporting the highest cumulative number of deaths relative to their population are San Marino (1238 per million population), Belgium (856 per million population) and Andorra (686 per million population).
In the South-East Asia Region, India, Indonesia and Bangladesh continue to report the highest number of cases, although the Maldives accounts for the highest number of cumulative cases relative to its population (16746 per million population). The region recorded 22% of all new deaths in the last seven days but retains low overall cumulative deaths relative to the region’s population (46 per million population) Myanmar is continuing to show increasing case numbers, with a greater than 250% increase in weekly new cases, resulting in more than a doubling of cumulative incidence from 24 to 51 per million population. Deaths remain low, with an incidence of <1 per million population. An influx of local travelers from Rakhine State to Yangon Region occurring since the end of August has contributed to increasing trends; as incidence rises, there are concerns of spread of cases from Myanmar across its border with Thailand, where cases have remained low (50 per million population) since peaks in early April.
Overall, the Western Pacific Region has the lowest cumulative cases (278) and deaths (6) per million population. The Philippines, Japan and the Republic of Korea have the greatest number of new cases in the region; however, Singapore holds the largest number of cumulative cases per million population at 9804. Malaysia showed an increase in weekly new cases of nearly 650%, averaging about 68 cases per day. Prior to this, Malaysia had been reporting fewer than 20 cases per day since the end of July. In the last seven days the cumulative cases per million population rose by 5% to 305 cases per million population).
To date, over 30.6 million COVID-19 cases and 950000 deaths have been reported to WHO. From 14 through 20 September, there were almost 2 million new cases of COVID-19, which represents a 6% increase compared to the previous week, and the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic. During the same period, there was a 10% decrease in the number of deaths, with 36764 deaths reported in the past seven days (Figure 1). With the exception of the African Region, an increase in the weekly case incidence was reported across all WHO regions in the last seven days (Table 1, Figure 2). Overall, the Region of the Americas continues to carry the highest burden of COVID-19 globally, accounting for over 38% of all new cases reported in the past seven days, although the region has reported a 22% decrease in new deaths. The WHO European Region showed the greatest rise in deaths in the past week, with a 27% increase compared to the previous week. The WHO South-East Asia Region has continued to report an increase in new COVID-19 deaths, with over 9000 deaths in the past week, accounting for 25% of all reported deaths and surpassing 100000 total COVID-19 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. In addition, the region accounts for 35% of new cases reported in the past week. The Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions have both reported a slight increase in reported cases and deaths over the last three weeks. The African Region continues to show a marked decline with decreases of 12% and 16% in reported cases and deaths respectively in the past week.
For the last six weeks, the African Region has continued to report a decrease in both COVID-19 cases and deaths. During the past week, 33 of the 49 affected countries reported either a decrease in deaths or no deaths. The region has reported almost 25000 cumulative deaths to date, of which South Africa accounts for 15900 (64%). South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and new deaths, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria and Mozambique. Notably, 35 of 49 affected countries/territories/areas in the Region continue to report ongoing community transmission.
The Region of the Americas remains the most affected WHO Region, accounting for 50% of all reported cases and 55% of deaths. Even though the Region has reported an increase of 10% in the number of new cases in the past week, it also accounts for the largest decrease in deaths compared to the previous seven days (-22%) (Figure 4). Thirty-two out of the 48 affected countries and territories in the Region report community transmission, while only eight report sporadic transmission. The countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases in the past week include the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. The number of daily cases reported in Ecuador has remained relatively high, with an average of more than 500 cases reported daily in September. The marked decrease in the number of deaths in the Region has been driven mainly by a decrease in Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Bolivia in the past seven days, while the United States of America and Brazil continue to report the highest number of deaths, each reporting over 5000 new deaths in the past week. While Argentina was one of the countries in the Americas with the lowest incidence of cases and deaths during the first few months of the pandemic, over the last few months the weekly incidence of cases has been rising rapidly, and test positivity rates have exceeded 40% in recent weeks.
The number of cases and deaths reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have consistently increased over the last three weeks (Figure 5), and have increased by 8% and 14% respectively in the last seven days. The highest numbers of new cases were reported by Iraq, Iran and Morocco. Jordan, Oman and Tunisia reported the greatest relative increase in cases compared to the previous week. While Iran reported the highest number of new deaths, Tunisia and Afghanistan reported the greatest increase in deaths compared to the previous week.
The number of cases and deaths reported in the European Region increased by 11% and 27% respectively in the past seven days (Figure 6), with France, the Russian Federation, Spain and the United Kingdom reporting the highest numbers of new cases in the past week. Iceland and Cyprus have reported the greatest percentage increase in new cases in the past week. The Region has been experiencing a slight increase in the number of reported deaths over the past four weeks, reaching over 4000 new deaths in the past seven days. Hungary and Denmark reported the highest relative increase in deaths in the past week, while the United Kingdom continues to report the highest number of cumulative deaths, with almost 42000.
The South-East Asia Region is the second most affected Region and currently accounts for 35% and 25% of cases and deaths, respectively, newly reported globally in the past seven days. Although the number of cases and deaths has been increasing steadily since March, the increases have slowed, with increases in new cases and deaths of only 1% and 4% respectively in the past week. The countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, while Myanmar and Nepal showed the highest increase in new cases in the past seven days. The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths per million population include India and Maldives, with 6 and 4 deaths per million population respectively, while Myanmar continues to show the highest increase in deaths in the past week.
Overall, the Western Pacific Region continues to show the lowest cumulative cases, accounting for less than 2% of global cases and less than 1.5% of all deaths. The Philippines and Japan accounted for the greatest number of new cases and new deaths in the Region. Relative increases in the number of deaths were reported in Malaysia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.
To date, over 32.7 million COVID-19 cases and 991000 deaths have been reported to WHO. During the week of 21–27 September, there were more than 2 million new cases and 36000 new deaths reported, which is similar to the numbers reported the previous week. Cumulative deaths are expected to exceed one million in the coming week. The Region of the Americas continues to carry the highest incidence of COVID-19 globally (Table 1), reporting similar numbers of new cases and deaths as the previous week. The Region accounts for 38% of all new cases and 52% of all new deaths reported in the past seven days. The Eastern Mediterranean Region showed the greatest increase (9%) in cases in the past week, while the European Region reported a substantial rise in deaths, with a 9% increase compared to the previous week. The WHO African, Western Pacific and South-East Asia Regions reported decreases in the new case and deaths over the past week.
The African Region continues its decreasing trend for the seventh week, reporting a 7% decrease in new cases and a 14% decrease in new deaths. During the past week, 33 of the 49 affected countries reported either a decrease in deaths or no deaths. South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and new deaths followed by Ethiopia, Uganda, Algeria and Mozambique. South Africa also has the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths per one million population in the Region, followed by Cabo Verde which has reported increasing numbers of cases and deaths over the past month. Cases in Mozambique have consistently increased over the last four weeks stretching health system capacity. More than half of the new cases (and total cases) are in the capital city, Maputo. Mozambique’s overall case rate, however, remains relatively low: 248 cases per million population and two deaths per million population.
The Region of the Americas remains the most affected WHO Region, accounting for 50% of all reported cases and 55% of deaths. The Region reported similar numbers of new cases and deaths this past week as compared to the previous week and accounts for 38% of new cases and 52% of new deaths. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia continue to report the highest number of new cases in the past week. Mexico reported the sixth highest number of new cases and third highest number of new deaths.
Over the past month, the number of new cases and deaths reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region has consistently increased, with a 9% and 3% increase respectively. The highest numbers of new cases were reported by Iraq, Iran and Morocco. Somalia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates and Tunisia reported the greatest relative increase in cases compared to the previous week. While Iraq reported the highest number of new deaths, Bahrain and Jordan reported the greatest increase in deaths compared to the previous week.
While the number of new cases and deaths reported in the European Region continued to increase in the past seven days, the rate slowed (Figure 6), with only a 5% increase in new cases and 9% increase in new deaths reported (compared to 11% and 27% increase, respectively, the previous week). France, the Russian Federation, Spain and the United Kingdom continue to report the highest numbers of new cases. Turkey reported the third highest deaths in last seven days after the Russian Federation and Spain. In France, the highest 7-day incidence was observed in the regions of Île-de-France , Hauts-de-France and Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur – the latter including the city of Marseille, which has emerged as the epicenter of the country’s second wave in recent weeks. While the number of hospitalized cases has doubled in the past 10 days, hospitalization numbers remain a magnitude smaller than observed earlier this year and hospital stays have tended to be shorter. Nonetheless, test positivity rates have continued to trend upwards (reaching 7.4% on 27 September), and 58/101 departments are now classified in the red zone indicating very high levels of infection. In the United Kingdom, there has been an increase in the number of people testing positive for COVID- 19 in all age groups, with the regions of Greater Glasgow and Clyde , the North West and the North East reporting the highest incidence in the past week. Wales has reported the highest rates of infection to date (727.7 per 100000 population), followed by England (664), Northern Ireland (566.6) and Scotland (504.7).
The South-East Asia Region is the second most affected Region, accounting for 21% and 11% of cumulative cases and deaths, respectively. While the Region had been reporting increasing cases and deaths since March, in the past week, a 7% decrease in new cases and a 3% decrease in new deaths were observed. The countries reporting the highest number of new cases continue to be India, Indonesia and Bangladesh, while Myanmar reported the highest increase in cases (92% increase) and deaths (80% increase) compared to the previous week.
Overall, the Western Pacific Region continues to show the lowest cumulative cases, accounting for just 2% of global cases and 1% of all deaths. The Philippines and Japan account for the highest number of new cases and new deaths in the Region. All countries in the Region except Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Guam reported decreases in new cases, as compared to the previous week. Only Malaysia reported an increase in new deaths. Incidence of COVID-19 in Papua New Guinea remains low. An 8-fold increase was reported in August (396 cases) compared to July (52 cases). The number of cases reported so far in September (73 cases) is lower but there may be other undetected cases since the testing and overall health care capacity in the country are limited.
The number of new cases per week has remained stable at 2 million for the past three weeks (Figure 1), with the cumulative total of over 34.8 million cases. Over 1 million deaths have now been reported globally, of which the majority were reported in the Region of the Americas (55%), followed by Europe (23%). In the past week, the regions of the Americas, South-East Asia, and Europe account for 91% of new cases. Five countries (namely India, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and France) reported 60% of new global cases this past week, while Israel registered the highest incidence (3717 new cases per 1 million population). Globally, the highest percentage of cases have been reported in the 25-39 age group, with approximately 50% of cases in the 25-64 age group. However, the percentage of deaths increases with age, and approximately 75% of deaths are in those aged 65 years and above. Although globally the number of new cases was similar to the number of cases in the previous week, there is considerable variation on a country-by-country basis. In several countries, the number of new cases is rising again, and in many (most notably within the European Region) the second wave is exceeding previous peaks; this can be partly attributed to enhancements in surveillance capacities over time. In other countries we have seen a gradual decline in new cases from earlier peaks in August, for example in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. In India and the Philippines, the number of new cases appear to have stabilized, but they are still reporting high numbers. There are also examples of countries that have consistently shown an increasing incidence as their first wave continues; these include Indonesia, Iraq, and Myanmar, although Indonesia is reporting a slight drop this week. South Africa and Australia are examples of countries that have successfully managed to reduce the number of new cases and have seen large reductions from earlier peaks.
South Africa and Ethiopia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in Africa, followed by Mozambique, Uganda, and Nigeria. Africa has seen a continuous decline in case incidence since mid-July; however, this trend is now slowing (Figure 3). For the first week since early August, the number of new deaths has risen – led by South Africa with a 29% increase in deaths in the past week. South Africa also has the second-highest mortality rate in the Region – 11461 deaths per 1 million population. The provinces of Gauteng and the Western Cape have reported the most cases and deaths to date; however, these regions, as well as the country itself, have maintained sustained declines in the daily incidence since the end of July. Despite this, weekly case numbers have continued to rise in less populated provinces. The country moved to Alert Level 1 as of 21 September (the least strigent of the five alert levels applied by the South African Goverment), with all sectors of the economy now open with strict adherence to public health protocols. A WHO surge team of experts, including infectious disease specialists and epidemiologists, is currently in South Africa, and is continuing to work with the National Department of Health. New weekly cases have risen in Angola from 400 in the week of 7 September to 698 cases in the past week, a 74% increase, although the number of new cases has declined by 10% from the past week. Angola recently upgraded their self-reported transmission classification from ‘clusters of cases’ to ‘community transmission’. Luanda province remains the epicentre with around 90% of all cases. A total of 16 out of the 18 provinces have reported confirmed cases. WHO has trained around 90 community health mobilizers now operating across Luanda.
A similar incidence of new cases was reported across the Region over the past week (Figure 4) in comparison to previous week. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Peru registered the highest number of weekly new cases. The United States of America continues to record approximately 300000 new cases per week (894 new cases per 1 million population). Declines observed over July and August have stagnated in recent weeks, with several states reporting sharp rises in case numbers – most notably in Midwest states. Canada is also showing a large increase in new cases and new deaths compared with last week, at 43% and 208% respectively. Likewise, Argentina continues to report an increase in cases and deaths, with cumulative deaths exceeding 20000 last week after a backlog of over 3000 reported deaths from Buenos Aires. Since peaking at just over 300000 new weekly cases in the week of 27 July, new cases in Brazil have fallen to 190000 new cases in the past week (898 new cases per 1 million population). Weekly new cases have also fallen in Colombia and Peru. In the Region of the Americas, as in other Regions, older persons are far more likely to experience severe disease following infection. Brazil reported that 76% of COVID-19 related deaths during February to September 2020 were in adults aged 60 years and older. In Peru, people over the age of 70 years had the highest COVID-19 mortality rates during March-May 2020 and estimates from Canada show that more than 80% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in long-term-care facilities. WHO has published guidance on Preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services with an annex providing a comprehensive set of actions for policy makers, national and local decision-makers and other actors.
A similar incidence of new cases was reported from the Eastern Mediterranean Region over the past week (Figure 5) in comparison to previous week. Iraq, Iran, Morocco, and Lebanon are reporting the highest numbers of new cases for the past week. Iraq has reported over 20000 cases per week since the beginning of August and this week just under 30000 cases new cases (745 cases per 1 million population) were reported. In Jordan, case incidence has almost doubled each week for the past five weeks, with over 6600 new cases (a 90% increase on the previous week) reported last week. Since the start of September, the Islamic Republic of Iran has shown an upward trend in weekly new cases and is reporting their highest number of new cases – 25000 new cases (298 cases per 1 million population) – since the beginning of the pandemic. Lebanon reported a 19% increase in new cases compared with the previous week and has one of the highest rates of new cases in the Region (1209 new cases per 1 million population). On 29 September, WHO also launched an initiative to rebuild the Ministry of Public Health's Central Drug Warehouse in Qaratina, Lebanon, which was destroyed by the Beirut port blast on 4 August.
The incidence of new cases has continued to increase in the European Region overall (Figure 6). France, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Israel reported the highest numbers of new cases in the past week. The numbers of new cases and new deaths in the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and several other countries in Europe are showing considerable increases compared with last week. The Netherlands, Czechia, Germany, and Italy have also reported sizeable increases. Israel continues to have the highest incidence of new cases per 1 million population in the Region and globally, with over 32000 cases reported in the past week (3717 new cases per 1 million population). With over 1.2 million COVID-19 cases, and over 63000 new cases in the past week (436 cases per 1 million population), the Russia Federation is reporting the second highest number of new cases in Europe and the sixth highest number globally. Russia’s weekly new cases peaked at 75000 cases in the week of 4 May, with a gradual decrease observed through late August, but rapid increases observed in the last three weeks. In contrast to other European countries, Ukraine did not observe a large first peak, but has reported a continuous increase in new cases since mid-June. Over 27000 new cases were reported in the past week (636 new cases per 1 million population), a 21% rise from the week before. Since the start of the outbreak, WHO has supported the Ministry of Health to further develop three key areas of its health system: health financing, service delivery, and governance. In September, WHO experts worked together with national authorities to make sure rehabilitation services are fully functional and well-integrated into health care.
A gradual decline in case and deaths incidence in the South-East Asia Region continued during the past week (Figure 7). Nevertheless, the Region contributes almost a third (n=614502, 30%) of new cases reported global in the past week. At the same time, current weekly case incidence (304 per 1 million population) is markedly lower than that which is currently observed in the Americas and Europe. India, reporting over 500000 new cases per week since late-August, again contributed the majority of incident cases in the Region (91%) and globally (27%) last week, bringing cumulative counts in the country to an excess of 6.5 million cases and 100000 deaths (10% of the global total). Over several months, case numbers in India rose rapidly, with Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh reporting the highest numbers of cases. This increase occurred with a concurrent expansion in testing activity, which has since stabilized at 7–8 million samples tested per week (or 5.2– 5.8 samples tested/1000 persons/week) in the past five weeks. Weekly incidence of new cases is gradually easing, falling to 403 new cases per 1 million population (556841 cases) this past week, after peaking three weeks ago, while test positivity rates fell marginally to 7.1%. Indonesia is currently the second most affected country in the Region, nearing 300000 cases to date, including over 28000 new cases (or 103 new cases per 1 million population) in the past week. Almost 60% of cases to date have been reported from the island of Java, which includes the capital Jakarta. Suspected case numbers have risen sharply in recent weeks; however, testing capacity has thus far been unable to meet demand, with approximately 23% (n=30940 people) people tested among some 132000 suspected cases reported on 30 September. Among four provinces that achieved a benchmark of 1 person tested/1000 population/week during September, weekly test positivity rates ranged markedly from less than 5% to over 40%, highlighting the heterogeneity in both surveillance capacity and COVID- 19 activities across the island. In Myanmar, COVID-19 incidence has risen sharply, with cumulative counts almost doubling each week since mid-August, and over 6500 new cases (or 120 new cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week. Rakhine State and the country’s largest city, Yangon has reported around 75% of cases, and has been hardest hit to date, with a possibility of community transmission in areas. On 20 September, Myanmar announced a stay-home order for its biggest city Yangon.
In the Western Pacific Region, the weekly number of new cases reported continues to fluctuate (Figure 8). The Philippines, Japan, and Malaysia are reporting the highest numbers of new cases, with Malaysia reporting an increase of 119% in new cases compared with last week. Around three-quarters (73%) of new cases in the region were from the Philippines. Although weekly new cases in the Philippines peaked in the week of 10 August, the incidence of new cases remains relatively high compared to others in the Region, with over 18000 new cases in the past week (165 cases per 1 million population). Data as of 29 September shows that 50% of cases are in the age group 20-39 years, while 60% of deaths are in those aged 60 years and over. There is community transmission in all regions of the country, with three regions - National Capital Region, Region 3, and Region 4A – showing higher transmission intensity. The National Capital Region continues to report the most cases, with half of national cases, where Metro Manila mayors have recommended the extension of the general community quarantine status for the month of October. In Malaysia, the weekly number of new cases has been increasing for the past 3 weeks, with 1319 cases reported in the past week (40 new cases per 1 million population). The state of Sabah has been the worst affected in recent weeks, accounting for 77% of cases reported in September. A number of clusters in other states have also been linked to travellers from Sabah. Malaysia has a nationwide recovery movement control order (RMCO) in place and most communities and services are operating under these limited restrictions. However, targeted enhanced movement control orders (TEMCO), the most stringent form of community and business restrictions, have been implemented in a number of areas with high levels of community transmission. The Solomon Islands recorded their first COVID-19 case: a student returning from the Philippines on a repatriation flight. The Solomon Islands have planned to use repatriation flights to return students studying in the Philippines and Indonesia. Since early January 2020, WHO has been working closely alongside Pacific Governments and Ministries of Health, in collaboration with partners, to ensure that countries are well prepared to respond to the threat of COVID-19.
Since the last Weekly Epidemiological Update issued on 5 October, over 2.2 million new cases and 39,000 deaths of COVID-19 have been reported across all six WHO regions. This is the highest number of reported cases so far in a single week. From 30 December through 11 October, over 37 million COVID-19 cases and 1 million deaths have been reported globally. Nearly half of these cases (48%) and deaths (55%) continue to be reported in the Region of the Americas with the United States of America, Brazil and Argentina accounting for the greatest numbers of new cases and deaths in the region. By WHO region, the European Region reported the greatest increase (34%) in cases in the past week while the African Region reported a substantial rise in deaths, with a 27% increase compared to the previous week. Within the African Region, South Africa continues to register more than half (56%, 690896) of all reported confirmed cases. For the third week in a row, the South-East Asia Region reported a decline in new cases and deaths, 6% and 8% respectively, compared to the previous week. The decline is mainly due to decreases in reported cases in India and Bangladesh. For the second week in a row, the Regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific reported increases in cases and deaths. Overall, during the reporting period, all the Regions showed an increase in cases except the South-East Asia Region. Countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past seven days include; India, the United States of America, Brazil, the United Kingdom and France.
Although the Region had seen a slow but continuous decline in newly- reported cases since mid-July, there were 11% more cases reported in the last 7 days compared to the prior week, reaching a total of over 1200000 cases (Figure 1, Figure 3). The current figures in the region represent 1% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3% of deaths reported worldwide in the past week. The increase in the number of newly- confirmed cases is partially attributed to the higher number of countries reporting an increase in cases (21 countries), compared to the previous week (14 countries). Although there are a greater number of countries reporting increases, the pattern of increasing cases is driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, which continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in the last 7 days, followed by Kenya, Uganda, and Algeria. Continuing the trend from last week, the number of reported deaths increased this week with South Africa accounting for the majority of the new deaths in the Region (74%). The current transmission pattern in the majority of the 47 Member States in the African Region is reported as community transmission (n=39, 83%), with five reporting clusters of cases, and only Seychelles, Mauritius and Eritrea currently reporting sporadic cases. South Sudan has reported a decrease in the number of newly -reported cases with an epidemiological link, with 29% in the past week, compared to 67% the week prior. This is attributed to a decrease in the proportion of cases that have been detected at a border crossing, where a history of travel can inform an epidemiological link. This past week, Mozambique registered 795 new cases (25 per million population) bringing the total figure to almost 10000 cases. Nevertheless, the country has registered a gradual decline over the last three weeks including a 39 and 40% decrease in new cases and deaths respectively in the past week, suggesting the epidemic may be slowing down in the country. While the number of tests per 1000 inhabitants has remained quite stable at 0.3 over the last 10 weeks, the test positivity rate has dropped this week to 9%. Schools have reopened with special measures to prevent further spread of the virus.
The Region of the Americas reported over 800000 new cases in the last seven days, a 6% increase in the number of new cases in the past week which is a bigger increase than the increase reported in the previous week. greater change than the week prior. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia registered the highest number of newly-reported cases. The Region also continues to account for a majority of all deaths reported globally in the past week (n=20500, 52%). Mexico, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia registered the highest number of new deaths. This past week, the United States of America reported the largest increase in newly-reported cases since early August, with over 327000 cases reported. Ten of the 50 states reported the highest one-day increases in cases since their first reported case, including many in the Midwest and the Southwest, and three states reported their largest-ever one-day increase in new deaths. The number of newly-reported cases has been increasing in Canada since mid-September, with an increase of 26.7% cases and 14.3% deaths in the past week. Most of the cases and deaths were reported in Québec and Ontario. Outbreaks in long-term care and retirement residences continue to account for most outbreaks in Canada to date. Since mid-July, incidence rates in those 20 to 39 years of age have remained consistently higher than all other age groups. Since mid-September, an increasing trend in the daily number of cases 20 to 39 years of age hospitalized has been observed. Costa Rica, with the second-highest incidence of cases per million population in the Region, has now reached over 86000 cases and over 1000 deaths. During the last 5 weeks, the country had reached a plateau with comparable figures of reported cases and deaths. The country has reported over 107 COVID-19 hospitalizations per million inhabitants of which over a third of them are in intensive care units.
In the Eastern Mediterranean region the weekly number of new cases and deaths have increased by 10% and 13% respectively in comparison to the previous week. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the worst affected country in the region, accounting for 20% of all new cases reported this week. The number of new cases in Oman has more than doubled in the last week (from approximately 2600 to over 5500) amounting to an increase of more than 60%. This past week a 100 bed field hospital for COVID-19 patients along with an isolation center in the city of Sohar, the capital and largest city of the Al Batinah North Governorate and another isolation ward in Sur Hospital in the South Sharqiya region were opened to help mitigate the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country. In Tunisia, there have been peak new cases (over 2500) and deaths (over 40) also reported this week and the country plans to impose increased public health and safety measures including bans on gatherings, cutting public sector work hours and imposing curfews in an effort to interrupt transmission.
The Region registered the highest weekly incidence of COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic with almost 700000 new cases reported. The weekly incidence in cases and deaths increased by 34% and 16% respectively in comparison to the previous week (Figure 6). The Region is the second most active, contributing almost a third (n=694275, 31%) of new weekly cases reported globally. The United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation and Spain account for over half of all new cases reported in the region (n=355455, 51%). Latvia, Faroe Islands and Iceland have reported the greatest percentage increase in new cases in the past week while a marked decrease was reported in Isle of Man, Malta and Spain. The majority of the countries in the region self-characterize their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=30, 56%) or clusters of cases (n=20, 37%) with only Liechtenstein, Monaco and the Holy See reporting sporadic transmission. Spain, with over 50000 cases reported in the past week, is showing a noticeable decline in the weekly incidence of cases and deaths of 24% and 19% respectively. In the past week, over 740000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests were carried out (16 tests per 1000 inhabitants per week). As of 08 of October, the bed occupancy in intensive care units ranged between 7% and 39% across all regions. The incidence of cases and deaths in Poland increased this week by 93% and 104% respectively compared to the previous week, with almost 23500 new cases and 370 deaths reported. Poland is tightening public health and social measures in response to these marked increases in an effort to avoid another lockdown. A coordination hospital will be created in each provide to manage the surge in COVID-19 patients.
The gradual decline in incidence of cases and deaths in the South East Asia Region continued during the past week. The Region, nevertheless, remains among the most active, accounting for 25% of cases and 20% of deaths newly reported globally in the past seven days (Figure 7). The countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the South-East Asia Region continue to be India, Indonesia and Nepal, while Sri Lanka and Bhutan are showing the highest increase in the proportion of new cases in the past week compared to the previous week. Across the ten countries in the region, only Myanmar and Nepal reported an increase in the number of new deaths in the past week compared to the previous week. The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths per million population are India and Myanmar, with 5 and 4 new deaths per million population respectively. In contrast to the other regions with currently high case incidence, most of the 10 Member States in the South-East Asian Region self-report their current transmission pattern as either clusters of cases (n=6) or sporadic cases (n=2), with only Bangladesh and Indonesia currently reporting community transmission. Sri Lanka reported over 1200 new confirmed cases in the past epidemiological week, a substantial increase compared to the 46 cases confirmed the previous reporting week. In a recent development, a large cluster of cases (831 cases as on 7 October 2020) was reported in an apparel manufacturing factory in Gamphana district about 50 km from Colombo. The exact epidemiological link is currently under investigation The reported number of cases increased rapidly in Nepal in the past week, with over 21000 new cases and 86 new deaths reported. Although the test positivity rate has raised from 5 to 15% in just 8 weeks, there has also been an expansion in testing activity, which is currently around 3 samples tested / 1000 persons per week.
The Western Pacific region accounts for the least number of reported cases globally this week, however, the region has experienced an increase of 6% in newly-reported cases and a 26% increase in reported deaths in the past seven days. New cases in the Philippines have stabilized over the past 3 weeks with around 18000 cases reported weekly, lower than the peak of around 30000 weekly new cases in early to mid- August however it does continue to account for the greatest number of new cases in the region. Reports suggest clustering of cases has occurred in several workplaces in Davao Region following the easing of lockdown restrictions under the modified general community quarantine and reopening of the economic measures, with most of the clusters reported in 12 establishments. As of October 12, the total number of cases in Davao Region is 3,743 with 686 cases reported in the past two weeks and Davao City (the capital) contributing 65% of the total cases in the region. There are also reports of near capacity utilization of ICU and Ward beds, in the ma jor hospital in the region last week. In French Polynesia, there were peak new cases this week, a 62% increase from last week, with reports suggesting most cases were detected from the main island of Tahiti, with cases spreading to adjacent islands of Moorea and even reaching several outer islands, including Raivavae, Arutua, and Nuku Hiva. Deaths in French Polynesia remain low and have not increased in the past week. The positivity rate of COVID-19 tests is currently high, at 26.3%, however only symptomatic persons are being tested.
The incidence of new COVID-19 cases has continued to accelerate, while the incidence of new deaths has remained relatively stable (Figure 1). As of 18 October, over 40 million cases and 1.1 million deaths have been reported globally, with over 2.4 million new cases and 36000 new deaths reported over the past week. The European Region has continued to report a rapid increase in cases and deaths, with over 927000 new cases reported this past week – a 25% weekly increase in cases compared to the previous week – contributing 38% of all new cases reported worldwide (Table 1). Similarly, the number of deaths continues to climb with a 29% increase from last week. Increases, although more gradual, were also observed in the African, Eastern-Mediterranean and Western Pacific Regions. Declines continued to be reported in the Region of the Americas and the South-East Asia Region; although the incidence of new infections remains high, and collectively these two regions contribute over half of new cases and deaths observed globally. The countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week remain the same as last week: India, the United States of America, France, Brazil and the United Kingdom.
Continuing trends in the previous week, the Region reported an increase in both cases and deaths in the last 7 days, with an 11% increase in new cases and an 8% increase in new deaths (Figure 3). The pattern of increasing cases continues to be driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, with Kenya, and Botswana also reporting notable increases. The majority of countries in the region are reporting community transmission of COVID-19 (n=39; 78%), with a further 7 (14%) classifying transmission as clusters of cases (n=7; 14%), 3 (6%) as sporadic cases, and 1 (2%) as reporting no active cases. An unusually high number of cases was reported from Botswana this week, with over 1,800 cases reported in one day. This was largely attributed to a backlog of tests administered from 2–13 October, mostly from in and around the capital city of Gaborone. South Africa has accounted for approximately 70% of deaths in the Region in the past week. The high number of deaths being reported is partially attributed to a mortality audit, and many of these deaths are retrospectively reported. Mauritania reported a large increase from last week (12 to 80 cases), all reported from the capital, Nouakchott. Although this is a higher number of cases than Mauritania has reported in recent weeks, it remains lower than the daily numbers reported in July.
A slight decrease in new cases was reported across the Region over the past week (Figure 4) in comparison to the previous week. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico continue to register the highest number of weekly new cases in the region, while the highest incidence of new cases per million population was reported in Argentina, Bahamas, Costa Rica and Saint Martin, all with more than 1,600 cases per million in the past 7 days. A marked decline in the incidence of deaths in the region continued this past week with just over 16000 new deaths, compared with 20000 new deaths last week. The Region, accounts for a third (n=798794, 33%) of new cases and almost half (45%) of new deaths reported globally in the past week. Most countries and territories in the region self characterize their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=34, 64%), with 8 (15%) classified as clusters of cases, 7 (13%) as sporadic cases, and 5 (9%) as no cases. Argentina remains the country in the region with the highest number of new cases and new deaths per million population with over 2,000 new cases per million inhabitants in the past week. Even though the weekly incidence of new COVID-19 cases is increasing gradually, a decreasing trend in the number of new deaths has been reported in the past two weeks, dropping from 6,000 deaths per week at the end of September to less than 2,500 deaths in the past week. Guatemala continues to register a gradual decline in the incidence of new cases, however, an 88% increase in new deaths (from 80 to 150 deaths) was reported the past 7 days. COVID-19 test positivity rates have also remained relatively high for the last 12 weeks with over 10% of samples testing positive. The highest incidence of cases and deaths was reported in the capital, Guatemala City, and has reached over 530 deaths per million population. Peru has the second-highest rate of deaths per 1 million population in the region with 1,024 deaths per million inhabitants. However, in the last week, modest decreases in case and death rates continued. Some regions have reported declines of 50% and the regions of Puno, Madre de Dios, Amazonas and Moquegua registered declines of 70% in the weekly incidence of COVID-19.
A gradual increase of new cases and deaths was reported by the Eastern Mediterranean Region over the past week (Figure 5), reaching the highest weekly incidence reported since the beginning of the pandemic, with almost 150000 new confirmed cases from 22 countries. In the past week, The Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq and Morocco are reported the highest number of new cases while Bahrain, Lebanon and Jordan report the highest incidence, with over 1,500 new cases per million population. A majority of the countries in the region continue to self-characterise their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=14, 64%), with 5 countries reporting clusters of cases and sporadic cases being reported in Somalia, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia. During the past week, Tunisia updated their classification from clusters of cases to community transmission. The Islamic Republic of Iran remains the most affected country in the region with Tehran, the capital city, being the most affected area. In this reporting period, Iran has recorded new weekly records, with over 30000 new cases (360 cases per million population) and over 1,800 deaths (22 new deaths per million population) reported, bringing cumulative counts in the country to over 534000 cases and 30000 deaths. Libya has shown a surge in cases, recording over 6,000 new cases (900 cases per million population). Test positivity rates also continue to gradually increase, with approximately 1 in 4 samples tested returning a positive result.
This week, the European Region again reports the highest increase in cases and deaths thus far – 25% and 29%, respectively compared to the previous week. In addition, the Region reported the greatest proportion of new cases globally (38%, n=927433). A media briefing by WHO Regional Director for Europe highlighted that the region is currently reporting over three times more cases per day compared to the April peak, with hospital admissions rising, although the number of daily deaths remains five times lower than they were in April. France, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation, Czechia and Italy continue to report a high incidence of new cases. Collectively, these five countries contribute to over half of all reported cases this week in the Region. A majority of the countries in the region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=34, 55%), with a further 20 (33%) countries reporting clusters of cases, 4 (6%) clusters of cases, 3 (<1%) no cases, and one pending classification. During the past week North Macedonia updated their classification from clusters of cases to community transmission. Slovenia reported over a 150% increase in new cases this week (from 1924 new cases last week to 4890 new cases this week) – the highest one-week increase the country has experienced so far. In addition, Slovenia reported 12 new deaths, compared to only one death last week. In response to this recent increase in cases and deaths, as of 19 October, the Slovenian government has declared a 30-day state of emergency with a daily curfew.
Overall, the region continues to show a decline in cases and deaths (Figure 7), with Nepal being the only country which reported an increase in both new weekly cases (12%) and new deaths (31%) in comparison to the previous week. Nepal reported 810 new cases per one million population, the highest in the region, followed by the Maldives (590) and India (319). Most countries in the region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as cluster of cases (n=6, 55%), with two countries reporting community transmission and a further two reporting sporadic cases. Bangladesh reported an 8% increase in new weekly cases. Among the 386086 cases reported as of 16 October, the majority (81%) were adults aged 21–60 years, and almost three-quarters (72%) were male. During the same timeframe, the country has conducted 2.13 million diagnostic tests, or 12900 tests per million population. Myanmar reported a 6% increase in new weekly deaths compared to last week. The majority of the cases and deaths continue to be reported from Yangon Region. Here, the Government has further extended stay at home orders for 44 townships from 8–21 October. On 3 October, Myanmar published standard operating procedures for testing of COVID-19 with antigen-based rapid diagnostic kits, and began using these in Yangon Region on 29 September, followed by other regions and states. Thailand continues to report relatively low numbers of cases. The country has become one of the first countries in the world to complete an assessment of how its health system has so far responded to COVID-19. The review highlights success factors and provides recommendations across nine areas, or “pillars” of the national response.
Overall, one percent of all new weekly cases and deaths were reported from the Western-Pacific Region. The region reported an 8% increase in new weekly cases and 27% decrease in new weekly deaths as compared to the previous week. The majority of new cases continue to be reported from the Philippines, Malaysia and Japan. Whereas French Polynesia and Guam reported the highest incidence of new cases – 3,713 and 3,258 new cases per one million inhabitants, respectively. Papua New Guinea reported an increase of over 200% in weekly cases as compared to the previous week, with 31 new cases and 581 total confirmed cases. Only two countries and territories in the region self-characterize their current transmission pattern as community transmission, with a further 9 (24%) countries reporting clusters of cases, and 7 (18%) countries reporting sporadic cases. The majority (n=19, 50%) of countries and territories report no active cases, and one territory is pending classification. Malaysia reported a 51% increase in cases and deaths as compared to last week, with the majority of cases reported from Sabah State. The Ministry of Health have taken several measures reduce transmission and increasing test capacity in the state – daily RT-PCR tests increased from 1,350 in July to 2,600 as of 17 October. Wallis and Futuna, reported its first positive case of COVID-19 to WHO on 19 October. As this falls outside of the reporting period of this update, the island territory will be reflected in next week’s update.
In the past week the highest number of new COVID-19 cases have been reported globally, amounting to over 2 million new cases in the past 7 days (Figure 1), the shortest intervals for this exponential increase since the start of the pandemic, while the number of new deaths is comparable to previous weeks. As of 25 October, over 42 million cases and 1.1 million deaths have been reported globally, with over 2.8 million new cases and nearly 40000 new deaths reported over the past week. For the second consecutive week the European Region accounts for the greatest proportion of reported new cases, with over 1.3 million new cases reported this past week – a 33% increase in cases compared to the previous week – contributing nearly half of all new cases reported worldwide this week (46%) (Table 1). Similarly, the number of deaths continues to increase in the region with a 35% increase from last week and accounting for nearly one third of all new deaths globally. Although not as substantial, increases in reported new cases were also observed in the Region of the Americas, Eastern-Mediterranean and African regions. Declines in cases and deaths continued to be reported in the South-East Asia region while the Western Pacific region has shown a slight decline in new cases and deaths in the past 7 days. Despite regional variations the countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week remain the same as the previous 3 weeks: India, the United States of America, France, Brazil and the United Kingdom.
With 32000 new cases and 800 new deaths over the past week, the Region accounts for around 1% of new global cases and 2% of new global deaths (Table 1). South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases. The Region shows a mixed pattern with countries at different epidemic stages and experiencing different outcomes. Despite this, COVID-19 continues to contribute an added burden to public health, strained already stretched health systems and caused socio-economic pressures. Cases in Ethiopia have declined from peaks in August when there were over 10000 cases a week, to just over 4400 new cases reported in the past week (38 new cases per 1 million population), a 12% decrease compared to the previous 7 days. The number of new cases in Ethiopia are the third highest in the WHO African region. Deaths in the country have increased slightly (6%) in the past week although overall numbers remain low (n=73) and the rate of new deaths is less than one (0.6) per 1 million population. Ethiopia, as well as other countries in the Horn of Africa, are facing a triple threat of floods from unusually heavy rains, desert locust crop destruction and the impacts of COVID-19-all threatening food security. With 4594 new cases over the past week (85 new cases per 1 million population), a 51% increase from last week, Kenya is now reporting the second highest numbers of new cases in the Region and has witnessed a dramatic rise since the week of 28 September when there were only 1000 new cases reported. It is just shy of its previous peak at the end of July, when there were 4700 new cases Although deaths have increased at a much lower rate (9%) and new deaths are just over one per 1 million population (1.3). Oxygen is one of the most essential medicines for saving patients with COVID-19, as well as many other conditions. One of the main barriers to medical oxygen is the high transport costs of the cylinders to the health facilities. In Kenya, a private sector company has positioned oxygen plants near clusters of health facilities and uses a milk delivery system to deliver oxygen to more than 140 clinics. WHO is committed to working in solidarity with all governments, partners and the private sector to scale up sustainable oxygen supply.
The Region of the Americas reported 880000 new cases (31% of the global total) and 17000 new deaths (43% of the global total) over the past week. The United States, Brazil, and Argentina continue to report the highest number of new cases (78% of regional new cases) and new deaths (67% of regional new deaths) in the Region. The number of new weekly cases in the United States has risen since the week beginning 7 September, when there were 240000 confirmed cases, to over 400000 confirmed cases over the past week. Cases are now approaching the previous epidemic peak in July. At 1318 new cases per million population, the incidence is lower in comparison to several European countries, such as the United Kingdom (2200 cases per million) and France (3300 cases per million). According to a US CDC report, the number of deaths from COVID-19 might underestimate the total impact of the pandemic on mortality, with an estimated 300000 excess deaths occurring from late January through 3 October 2020, of which 200000 excess deaths can be attributed to COVID-19. Colombia has reported just over 1 million cumulative cases since the start of the pandemic, with the number of weekly new cases remaining stable with approximately 53000 new cases (1053 new cases per 1 million population) and 1100 new deaths (23 new deaths per 1 million population) reported this week. Cases in Colombia peaked in the week of 10 August at 77915 cases, dropping to 43000 cases in the week of 28 September, but have risen in October. In the week beginning 28 September, Canada exceeded its previous peak of roughly 12000 new cases per week observed in late April. In October the number of cases has continued to rise, with over 17000 new cases in the last week (467 new cases per 1 million population). The number of new deaths per week has also risen in October, with 166 deaths reported for the past week, although these numbers are far lower than they were in April and May when over 1000 weekly new deaths were reported. Quebec and Ontario, which account for approximately 60% of the population of Canada, account for nearly 80% of cases. There have been reports suggesting that this rise may be partly attributable to social gatherings during Thanksgiving, which was celebrated in Canada on 12 October.
In the past 7 days there have been 159000 new cases and 4000 deaths reported in the Eastern Mediterranean region. This represents a 6% increase in cases from last week and there has been a steady increasing trend seen in the region over the past two months. While Iran continues to report the highest number of new cases in the region, the highest number of new cases per 1 million population is seen in Jordan, while the highest new deaths and new deaths per 1 million population remain highest in Iran. Jordan has reported an acceleration of new cases this past week and reached a peak of reported daily new cases in the past seven days. Bahrain reports the second highest new cases per 1 million population (1413) and the highest cumulative cases of 47001 per 1 million population. Increased public health and safety measures are seen throughout the country and the Ministry of Health for the Kingdom of Bahrain have recently published two new guidance documents, the first addressing health requirements to be applied in establishments serving shisha to contain and prevent the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and the other aims to establish health measures to be observed by restaurants and coffee shops to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. While the number of new cases in Djibouti remains low, there has been an increasing trend in new cases for the past three weeks. New cases reported in the country last week showed a 480% increase (from 5 to 29) compared to three weeks ago, week beginning 28 September. This week Djibouti reported 78 new cases, a 169% increase from the previous week. These steady increases in new cases are not at previous peaks seen in June, when there were 975 cases in the first week of June, but are still of concern. As a result the Ministry of Health announced they will be closing land borders from 20 October for 15 days.
The number of new cases and deaths reported in the European region are increasing exponentially, with 36% and 37% increase in cases and deaths respectively compared to the previous week, the highest percentage increase reported in a single week in the region. Although the number of deaths is gradually increasing, the proportion of deaths to cases remains relatively low, compared to the early phase of the pandemic in the spring. Approximately 1.3 million cases and 11700 deaths were reported in the last 7 days, accounting for 46% and 30% respectively of the total number of cases and deaths reported globally. France accounted for the greatest number of new cases, over 200000 cases, reported in the past 7 days. In the last week, hospitalizations due to COVID-19 and ICU occupancy increased in 21 countries across the region, compared to the previous week, however, current figures represent about 25% of the numbers reported during the peak level early in the pandemic. Based on surveillance data reported, an estimated 18% of reported COVID- 19 cases have been hospitalized, with 7% of hospitalized patients requiring ICU and/or respiratory support. In the United Kingdom, new cases have increased by 30% in the past week. The number of hospitalizations in Wales has sharply increased in the last week, increasing the pressure on frontline staff. There was also a steep increase in the number of ICU admissions among COVID-19 cases aged over 65 years old in England. Other countries reporting high hospitalization rates include Czechia, where new deaths per 1 million population are currently the highest (67) since the start of the pandemic and hospitals are expected to be at maximum capacity by mid-November and Italy where hospitals in Milan are stretched to capacity and temporary clinics have been reopened to manage the burden on the health system. In the last week, Slovenia reported their highest daily increase in the number of new cases, 1964, the rapid rise in cases has resulted in the health care system being stretched to capacity. To reduce transmission, the country was split into "red" and "orange" zones based on reported case numbers and Public Health and Social Measures were implemented accordingly.
A continued declining trend in new cases and deaths was observed in the South-East Asia this week, this decline in new cases and deaths has been a weekly trend for the past five weeks with the largest decrease in new cases (decrease of 13%) and deaths (decrease of 16%) seen in the past 7 days. Steady decreases in cases have been seen in the past month in India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Maldives and Bhutan with other countries in the region continuing to fluctuate. The only country in the region this week to report a substantial increase in new cases has been Sri Lanka reporting 2046 new cases (96 new cases per 1 million population) compared to 847 new cases (40 new cases per 1 million population) last week. In an effort to decrease the burden at one of its largest hospitals, government authorities have decided to restrict the number of all outpatients patients visiting the Colombo National Hospital. As an alternative a landline and mobile service to obtain medicines at the clinics of the Colombo National Hospital. While India is still reporting the highest number of new cases and deaths in the region, trends in these numbers for the country continue to decrease. India have reported 370260 new cases (268 new cases per 1 million population) a decrease of 16% in the past week. 4503 new deaths (3.3 new deaths per 1 million population) were reported this week amounting to a 21% decrease in new deaths compared to the previous 7 days. With upcoming cultural events such as Diwali, the Ministry of Culture issued a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for cultural functions to facilitate organization of cultural events during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustained declining trends have also been observed in the Maldives, with new cases down 24% from last week and continuing to be seen mostly from Greater Malé region. Additionally nearly all cases belong to known and existing clusters.
Following a three-week increase in the number of cases reported in the Western Pacific region, the number of weekly new cases decreased by 4% in the last 7 days. The decrease in the number of cases observed was predominantly driven by the decrease reported in Papua New Guinea (94% decrease) and the Philippines (23% decrease). Similarly, the number of deaths reported in the last 7 days decreased by 6%. Approximately 27000 cases and 430 deaths were reported in the region, accounting for just 1% of the total number of cases and deaths reported globally. The number of cases and deaths in Malaysia has consistently increased in recent weeks, and in the last 7 days, an average of 873 cases and 6 deaths were reported daily, amounting to 189 new cases and 1.3 new deaths per 1 million population. This resulted in an increase of 35% and 64% of cases and deaths respectively compared with the previous week. The rapid increase in cases and deaths is putting the public health system under immense pressure. Despite the decrease in cases reported in the Philippines, the country accounted for about 50% of the total number of cases and 75% of the total number of deaths reported in the region in the last 7 days. Relative to the country’s population, new cases (123) and new deaths (3) per 1 million population remain low compared to other countries in the region. Heavy flooding, affecting over 35000 households have been reported in the island of Mindanao, resulting in the evacuation of more than 12000 people. This could affect COVID-19 response measures in the region as many displaced families are staying in makeshift tents. Mindanao also continues to report new health worker infections and an overall increasing trend in COVID-19 cases.
In the past week, over 3.3 million new cases have been reported globally (Figure 1). As of 1 November, nearly 46 million cases and 1.2 million deaths have been reported globally. The further acceleration in the incidence of new cases was most notable in European Region, which reported half of global new cases (over 1.7 million cases - a 22% increase from the previous week. Moreover, the region also reported a substantial rise in the number of new deaths (a 46% increase compared with the previous week), with Europe and the Americas now each reporting over 17000 new deaths in the last 7 days.) The Americas and the Eastern-Mediterranean Regions have also seen relatively smaller rises in the number of reported cases. The South-East Asia Region has continued to report a decline in new cases and deaths, while case incidence continues to fluctuate around similar rates compared to recent weeks in the African and Western Pacific Regions (Table 1). Despite regional variations, the countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week remain the same as in the previous four weeks: The United States of America, India and France. Since the start of the pandemic, nine countries have reported more than 1 million confirmed cases: the United States, India, Brazil, Russian Federation, France, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, and the United Kingdom. Five have reported over 40000 cumulative deaths: the United States, Brazil, India, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
The African Region continued a four-week trend with a gradual increase in the number of new cases reported in the past 7 days (Figure 5), reporting almost 33000 new cases – 1% of new global cases in the past week. Although the number of new cases has increased slightly, the number of new reported deaths has continued to decline since a spike was observed three weeks ago following the retrospective capturing of a large number deaths in South Africa. South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases, while the highest number of new deaths per million population in the region was reported by South Africa (6 new cases per million population). In Nigeria, after a peak in cases at the end of June and in July, weekly new cases have decreased gradually since September. In the past week, 923 new confirmed cases (4 cases per million population) were reported, while deaths have remained relatively low. Nigeria has a relatively low testing rate and is currently conducting 1.2 diagnostic tests per 10000 population per week. The test positivity rate has remained relatively stable for the last 7 weeks and is currently 4%. This past week Uganda recorded a new highest daily increase in COVID-19 cases, with over 430 cases reported on 30 October and close to 1200 cases (26 cases per million population) reported during the week. With almost half of the new cases reported from the capital, Kampala remains the most affected region. From the beginning of the epidemic, a total of 862 healthcare workers have been infected and 8 have died (7% of overall cases and deaths). Health Authorities in Kampala, in collaboration with WHO, are taking a data and equity-oriented approach to the COVID-19 response and city authorities have been assessing the susceptibility of local communities to the impact of the virus with a new COVID-19 vulnerability framework.
Although the Region as a whole reported a 13% rise in cases compared with last week (Figure 6), continued declines were observed in many countries, especially in South America. The United States of America, Brazil, and Argentina continue to report the highest number of new cases, with the United States reporting a 26% increase this week to over 500000 new cases (1650 cases per million population). The overall change in the number of new deaths being reported in the Region, a 2% increase, is much lower than the rapid rise seen in the European Region. Colombia has now reported over 1 million cumulative cases and 31000 cumulative deaths. Cases in Colombia peaked in the week of 10 August at 77915 cases, dropping to 43000 cases in the week of 28 September, but have risen in October, with 64200 new cases (1250 cases per million population) and 1300 new deaths reported this week. Approximately 40% of cases are aged 20-39 years. Although 30% of cases are in people aged 60 years and older, this age group accounts for 76% of deaths. A total of 64% of deaths are male. As of 25 October, around 38% of hospital beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients. In Mexico, the number of new weekly cases rose to just under 47000 at the end of July. Although cases have fallen since then, they have remained above 30000 per week (295 new cases per million population reported last week). On 28 October, the Ministry of Health reported that the median age of cases is 43, with Mexico City, State of Mexico, Nuevo León, Guanajuato, and Sonora reporting the highest number of cumulative cases. Mexico City has recorded 17% of cumulative cases and has the highest number of active cases (>3,000 cases), followed by Nuevo León, Guanajuato, State of Mexico, and Coahuila, which all have more than 1000 active cases. Men account for f 64% of deaths a, with a median age of 63 years. Based on a recent study on excess deaths, the Ministry of Health has said that as many as an additional 50000 excess deaths can be attributed to COVID-19. In Peru, case incidence has continued to fall since reaching a peak in the week of 17 August when there were just under 60000 cases. In the past week, 17000 new cases (520 cases per million population) and 370 new deaths were reported. Around 45% of cases have been reported from one department – the region of the capital Lima. The Ministry of Health reports that as of 28 October, 4.4 million people have been tested for COVID-19. As of 28 October, there are 5419 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, of which 1052 were in intensive care. The government has approved a decree extending the state of national emergency through November.
Over the past two months, the Eastern Mediterranean Region has observed a steady increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases recorded (Figure 7), with 182000 reported in the past week (accounting for 5% of all cases reported globally). In the past 7 days, there has been a 10% increase in the number of deaths reported with a total of 4700 new deaths. The Region shows a mixed pattern with countries at different epidemic stages and experiencing different outcomes. Countries reporting the highest number of cases over the past week include the Islamic Republic of Iran, Morocco and Iraq, all reporting over 550 new cases per 1 million population in the past 7 days. The countries with the highest number of new deaths per million population in the past week are Tunisia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Jordan, with over 28 new deaths per million population. Since early September, the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the Islamic Republic of Iran has been increasing gradually, reaching over 50000 new cases (600 cases per million population) and 2500 new deaths in the past week. The country has the highest mortality rate overall in the Eastern Mediterranean Region with a total of 415 deaths per million population since the beginning of the pandemic. In the past week, the Islamic Republic of Iran extended public health and social measures in the capital of Tehran and across the country, as health authorities declared that they were recording a death from the virus every four minutes. Some hospitals have exceeded bed capacity to treat new patients. The closure of schools, mosques, shops, restaurants and other public institutions in Tehran, that was due to end on 26 October, will now be extended until 20 November. Morocco has been experiencing a gradual increase in cases and deaths since the beginning of August. This past week, the country registered a new record in new cases with over 24600 new cases and 440 new deaths. Currently, the country’s COVID-19 fatality rate is around 1.7%. Casablanca-Settat is the most affected region with the majority of cases coming from the city of Casablanca. According to local authorities, this week the reproductive number has stabilized at 0.8%. The test positivity rate has raised from 11% to 16% in just three weeks. More restrictive measures have been applied in the region of Casablanca-Settat following the rise in the incidence of COVID-19. Other regions have also adopted new measures including earlier closure of shopping centres.
The European Region has seen a 22% increase in new cases and a 43% increase in new deaths in the past 7 days compared with the previous week (Figure 8). France, Italy, and the United Kingdom reported the highest numbers of new cases, although Andorra, Czechia, and Belgium reported the highest per population incidence. France accounted for the third-highest number of new cases globally, with over 275000 cases reported in the past week (4200 cases per million population): a 27% increase from the previous week. The number of new cases has increased since August, in line with much of Europe; however, in October there has been a considerable escalation . As of 29 October, there were 24000 hospitalizations, with 3500 in intensive care, with the Ile-de-France and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes regions having the highest numbers of hospitalizations. The COVID-19 occupancy rate of intensive care beds is rising rapidly. The increases in indicators are most marked among people aged 65 and over. The President of the Republic announced the reinstatement of stricter public health and social measures from 30 October to 1 December. Belgium and Italy have both seen rapid rises in cases, and reported the 2nd and 9th highest number of new cases in Europe, respectively. New cases in Belgium fell by 21% from last week to 82500 new cases, while those in Italy rose by 72% from last week to 175000 new cases. Despite the fall seen in Belgium, it still has one of the world’s highest incidences of new cases per million population , with 7000 new cases per million. Italy’s incidence is lower at 2800 cases per million. Belgium has instituted a second phase of national containment measures. Italy and several other European countries have been experienced an increasing number of protests over government restrictions. In Switzerland, the number of new cases has grown considerably in October, rising from fewer than 2500 new weekly cases reported from mid-April through to the end of September, and fewer than a hundred cases reported in some weeks, to 50000 new cases in the past week. Switzerland has the fifth-highest incidence of new cases per million population in the Region (5800 cases per million population). The weekly number of hospitalizations has also risen considerably. While weekly testing rates have increased, test positivity rates have also increased from 15% to 22.5% (as of 25 October). Since the beginning of September, the median age of cases has been steadily increasing from 33 to 42 years, as of 25 October. Switzerland has progressively implemented strict public health and social measures in recent weeks, with a new range of national restrictions coming into effect on 29 October, with several cantons implementing additional measures.
New cases and deaths in the South-East Asia Region this week have continued to decline (Figure 9) . This is mainly due to a decline in reported cases in India, which contributes over 80% of all cases in the Region. Additionally, large rates of decrease have been reported seen in Nepal, Indonesia, and Bhutan. There have been over 380000 new cases reported in the past 7 days, bringing the cumulative amount of cases to over 9.2 million. In contrast to other countries in the region, Sri Lanka reported a 53% increase in the past 7 days from 2046 new cases to 3142 new cases (147 cases per million population). This follows a cluster detected in a garment factory on 3 October. A curfew was imposed in Colombo District and other high-risk areas from 29 October to 2 November. Additionally, active cases have been admitted to dedicated COVID-19 treatment hospitals, where 4764 patients were admitted to 37 hospitals as of 28 October. The government is also upgrading around 60 divisional hospitals as isolation and treatment centers to add more bed capacity. Indonesia has been showing a decreasing trend of new cases for the last 4 weeks. The country reported around 24000 new cases (88.1 per 1 million population) in the last past 7 days, and over 410000 cumulative cases to date. WHO, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the National COVID-19 Task Force, has conducted a series of focus group discussions for a detailed review of challenges and possible solutions for enhancing contact tracing.
The Western Pacific Region continues to account for the fewest cases and deaths reported globally, with declines observed in the past 2 weeks (Figure 10). There have been over 26000 new cases (13.5 new cases per million population) reported in the past 7 days, resulting in almost 734000 cumulative cases to date. The Philippines continues to report the highest number of new cases (12910 cases) and new deaths (287 deaths), representing almost 50% of new cases and 75% of new deaths in the region in the last 7 days; although incidence remains relatively low compared to other countries (117 new cases per million). The Marshall Islands reported their first two COVID-19 cases this week on 28 October. According to the national authorities, the two cases were identified on a military base on Kwajalein Atoll, although they were not epidemiologically linked. Over 240 new cases have been reported in China in the past 7 days, an increase of 32% compared with the previous week. A cluster of new cases related to local factories was identified in the autonomous region of Xinjiang between 24 and 28 October. Local authorities confirmed 45 cases and 138 asymptomatic cases, after 4746500 residents of Kashgar were tested.
In the past week, the global number of cases of COVID-19 has increased by 8% compared to the previous week, totalling more than 3.6 million new cases, while new deaths have increased by 21% to over 54000. This brings the cumulative numbers to over 49.7 million reported cases and over 1.2 million deaths globally since the start of the pandemic. The European Region continues to account for the greatest proportion of new cases and deaths in the past 7 days, the Region reported over half (54%) of all new cases and nearly half (47%) of new deaths. Although it still accounts for only 2% of the global total number of cases and deaths, this week the Western Pacific Region showed the largest relative proportional increase in new cases (19%) compared to the previous week followed by the Eastern Mediterranean Region (18%) and the European region (11%). The three regions reporting the highest proportional increases in newly reported deaths in the past 7 days compared to the previous week are Europe (44%), Africa (30%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (23%). The Western Pacific Region was the only region to report a decrease in deaths (5%) this week compared to the previous week. The five countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week were The United States of America, France, India, Italy and the United Kingdom.
The number of new cases continues to increase very gradually in the African Region, which reported nearly 34000 new cases and 831 new deaths in the past week. The number of new deaths reported in the last 7 days was 30% higher than it was in the previous week, driven largely by increases seen in South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda. South Africa continues to report the highest number of new cases and deaths in the Region, accounting for nearly a third of new cases and over half of new deaths. The number of new cases reported by South Africa peaked mid-July, the height of winter, when there were more than 86000 cases reported weekly. By September, South Africa was reporting fewer than 15000 cases per week, and in the past week there were nearly 10500 cases reported (176 new cases per million population). The number of deaths has also fallen from over 1500 deaths per week at the end of July and beginning of August, to 513 deaths reported in the past week (although this is 55% higher than it was in the previous week). As of 31 October, five provinces reported over 80% of cases: Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Free State. The median age of COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 39 years, and 58% of cases are female. The reason for this higher prevalence among females could be due to females being more represented in certain occupations in education and health sectors where they may be at greater risk of infection, as well as differences in health seeking behavior. Kenya is reporting the second-highest number of weekly new cases in the African Region. The number of new cases rose at the end of July, with 4700 cases in the week beginning 27 July. The number of cases then has risen considerably in October, rising from 1000 new cases in the first week of October (28 September-4 October) to 6577 cases (122 new cases per million) in the past week.
The Region of the Americas reported over 1 million new cases in the last week, a 3% increase as compared to the previous past week. The Region accounted for 32% of all deaths reported globally in the past week (n=17289). The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico reported the highest number of new cases in the last 7 days. Brazil has reported over 5.6 million cumulative cases and over 162000 cumulative deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of cases reported per week peaked in the week of July 27 at 319119 cases and has gradually decreased since then, although the absolute number remains high. In the last week Brazil reported 114523 new cases and 2538 deaths which represent 30% and 16% decreases respectively compared to the previous week. The Southeast region of the country reported the highest cumulative numbers of cases and deaths with over 1.9 million cases and 73261 deaths, followed by the Northeast region with over 1.4 million cases and 42480 deaths, as of 4 November 2020. In Rio de Janeiro, businesses, beaches, private schools and nurseries have reopened with restrictions. Martinique reported the highest surge in cases since the beginning of the pandemic in the week beginning 26 October, with 1024 cases reported. In the past week, 397 new cases (1058 new cases per 1 million population) were reported, which is a 61% decrease compared to the previous week. This decrease was the first downward trend in weekly cases since the week beginning 21 September. On 30 October, movement and travel restrictions were instated to limit contact and travel in Martinique. Schools, excluding higher education institutions, remain open with reinforced public health measures. In Belize, the number of new cases reported surpassed 500 for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak, with 554 new cases and nine new deaths reported in the past week bringing the total deaths in the country to 67. As of 8 November, approximately 45% of confirmed cases were female, and the highest number of cases were reported from Orange Walk district followed by Belize district.
In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the weekly number of new cases increased by 18% compared to the previous week, bringing the cumulative number of cases to over 3.3 million. In the past week, the number of new deaths in the region increased by 23%, bringing the cumulative number of deaths to over 84000. The Islamic Republic of Iran, Morocco, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon reported the highest number of new cases in the last seven days. Iraq reported 23389 new cases in the past week (581 new cases per 1 million population). The weekly number of new cases has remained over 23000 since the week beginning 10 August. The number of deaths per week peaked in the week of 29 June and has gradually decreased to 373 per week (9.3 deaths per 1 million population) in the current reporting period. Lebanon has recorded 11869 new cases (1739 new cases per 1 million population) and 76 new deaths (11.1 new deaths per 1 million population) in the past week. There has been an upward trend of cases and deaths in the past eight weeks in Lebanon. In Tunisia, 8428 new cases were reported in the past week, which was just over a 10% decrease compared to the previous week. There were 500 new deaths reported in the past week, which was an 8% increase compared to the previous week. On 29 October, Tunisian authorities stated that classes in elementary and middle schools will be suspended and premises disinfected.
The number of new cases and deaths reported in the European Region continues to increase exponentially with 11% and 44% more cases and deaths respectively in the past week compared to the previous week, a record of weekly number of cases since the beginning of the epidemic. Moreover, test positivity rates have been steadily increasing since August and have shown a marked escalation in recent weeks. This week, the region recorded 54% of all new cases and 47% of all new deaths reported globally bringing cumulative counts in the region to over 13 million cases and 311000 deaths. Deaths have increased markedly in the past 7 days with France, Spain and Italy reporting the highest counts of new deaths while Czechia, Belgium and Slovenia reported the highest mortality rates per capita. Most of the Member States in the European Region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as either community transmission (55%, n=34) or clusters of cases (32%, n=20). Over the past three weeks, Denmark has registered an increase in weekly incidence of COVID-19 cases reaching almost 1400 new cases per 1 million population (14% increase on the previous week). Since June 2020, 214 human cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Denmark with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks, including 12 cases with a unique variant, reported on 5 November. In the past few days, the Danish Prime Minister announced a planned cull of all mink in the country and imposed stricter public health and social measures in the area where the variants associated with farmed mink have been detected in humans. This week, Spain became the country with the sixth highest number of COVID-19 cases globally, recording over 2000 new cases per 1 million population and bringing cumulative counts in the country to an excess of 1.3 million cases and almost 40000 deaths. In the last weeks, the number of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital has increased steadily and as of 6 November, 6 of the 17 Autonomous Communities in Spain have reached over 40% Intensive Care Unit (ICU) occupancy. Over the last week, a majority of outbreaks affecting 10 people or more in the country continue to be located in care homes for the elderly.
The South-East Asia Region had observed a continued declining trend in new cases and deaths over the past six weeks. However, in the past 7 days, almost 400000 new cases (a weekly increase of 2%) and over 5000 deaths (a weekly increase of 10%) were reported in the region. The countries reporting the highest numbers of new cases in the South-East Asia region continue to be India, Indonesia and Nepal, while the highest mortality rates were recorded in Nepal and Myanmar. The only country in the region this week to report a substantial increase in new deaths has been Nepal. In the past week, Nepal reported its highest weekly increase in the number of new deaths with 5 deaths per 1 million population (58% increase compared to the previous week). Moreover, in the past 7 days, Nepal had the highest incidence of new cases per 1 million population (717 new cases per 1 million population) in the region. On 5 November, Nepal reported over 400 cases in ICUs across the country. In the past week and for the first time in seven months, the country reopened to those intending to climb or trek mountain trails. While India is still reporting the highest number of new cases and deaths in the region, trends in these numbers for the country have stabilized in the past week. Even though the country has reached a total of over 9.5 million cases and almost 127000 deaths cumulatively, in the past week, India recorded 230 new cases and 3 deaths per 1 million population. The most affected regions in the country are Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andra Pradesh while the regions with the highest number of active cases as of 8 November are Maharashtra, Kerala and Delhi. A stablisation in the incidence of cases and deaths has also been observed in Bangladesh in the past few weeks recording less than 70 new cases and less than 1 death per 1 million population in the past week (11000 cases and 126 new deaths). In Cox’s Bazar District, which hosts one of the world’s largest refugee settlements, the incidence trends have remained relatively low since early July with a cumulative total of 5255 COVID-19 cases reported as of 4 November 2020.
The number of new cases reported in the last week in the Western Pacific (31370) rose by the highest percentage globally, with a 19% increase compared to the previous week. Despite this increase, the number of new cases reported represents 1% of new cases reported globally last week. The number of new deaths was 5% lower than the previous week. The Philippines, Malaysia, Japan and French Polynesia continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in the Region: the Philippines reported 13232 new cases (121 new cases per million); Malaysia reported 7809 new cases (241 new cases per million); and Japan reported 5940 new cases (47 new cases per million). The number of new cases in Japan peaked in the week of 3 August with over 10000 cases. The number of new cases then dropped until the week of 21 September when just over 3000 cases were reported. However, it has since been rising, and there were 5940 new cases reported in the past week (a 29% increase from the previous week). Despite this increase last week, Japan reported 47 new cases per 1 million population, a relatively low number. Similarly, the number of new deaths in Japan remains very low and decreased by 16% compared with the previous week to 46 deaths, with only 0.4 deaths per million population. COVID-19 cases started rising in French Polynesia from only a few cases at the beginning of August to 2733 new cases reported last week. The number of new cases rose by 95% from the previous week. Cases in the Republic of Korea have gradually increased in October, from around 500 new cases per week at the start of the month to 799 new cases reported in the week of 26 October. Last week the Republic of Korea reported 792 new cases which is a 1% decrease in comparison to the previous week.
The number of new cases being reported globally continues to rise (Figure 1), with almost 4 million new cases in the past week (9–15 November) alone. The number of new deaths globally has also grown by 11%, with almost 60000 new deaths reported, of which 81% were in Europe and the Americas (Table 1). Although the European Region continues to report the highest number of new cases globally (46%), it has seen a 10% fall in the past week following the strengthening of public health and social measures across the region. However, the number of new deaths in Europe has increased substantially with over 29000 new deaths reported in the past week. The Region of the Americas reported a sharp upward trend, with a 41% increase in new cases in the past week. The Eastern Mediterranean, African and Western Pacific Regions also reported increases in the number of new cases. The South-East Asia Region, on the other hand, reported a decline in the number of new cases and new deaths. As of 15 November, over 53.7 million cases and 1.3 million deaths have been reported globally. Countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week included: the United States of America (reporting over 1 million new cases, a 47% increase compared to the previous week), India (306000 cases, 5% decrease), Italy (242000 cases, 9% increase), France (203000 cases, 47% decrease), and Brazil (179000 cases, 57% increase).
In the African Region, the gradual increase in the number of new weekly cases since last September continued, with 40990 new cases reported, a 22% increase compared to the previous week (Figure 3). Death rates across the region remained similar to the previous week. South Africa, Kenya, Algeria and Ethiopia reported the largest number of new weekly cases in the region. Algeria reported a sharp (131%) increase in the past week, with 5806 new cases detected (132 cases per 1 million population) and 114 new deaths reported. Local authorities also reported a substantial rise in hospitalisations in October, most notably in the north-eastern and north-central provinces. On 8 November, the Algerian Government implemented 12 additional new public health and social measures to mitigate this surge, including the reinstatement of a night-time curfew, closure of vehicle markets for 15 days, banning public and family gatherings, and postponing the start of university classes and vocational training until 15 December. In Angola, the incidence of new cases continued to decline, with 1039 new cases (32 cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week, a 32% decrease compared to the previous week. Nineteen new deaths were reported in the past week. As of 14 November, 66% of confirmed cases reported in Angola were male and 86% were individuals aged 20 to 69 years. The capital city of Luanda has been considered the epicentre of the outbreak in the country, with 78% of cumulative cases and 84% of deaths to date. On 11 November, the South African government further eased public health and social measures as the national incidence of new cases remains relative steady, with about 13000 new cases (224 cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week, while rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths continue to fall. However, the government warned of potential resurgence, highlighting recent spikes in cases observed in Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan area, Eastern Cape Province, potentially triggered by outbreaks in educational institutions and among people attending large gatherings.
Cases and deaths in the Region of the Americas continue to rise (Figure 4), with cases increasing over 40% and deaths over 10% in the past 7 days. The United States of America reported the largest number of cases in the Region, with over 1 million cases (3036 cases per 1 million population) in the past week, amounting to nearly 11 million cumulative cases since the start of the pandemic. In Canada, upward trends in both cases and deaths have continued, with over 30000 new cases (835 new cases per 1 million population) and just under 400 new deaths (10 new deaths per 1 million population) in the past week. Increased activity has also been reported among vulnerable populations and settings (such as elderly adults and Indigenous communities, and in a range of settings including long-term care and assisted living facilities, schools, congregate living settings, industrial work settings and social gatherings). Overall, nearly 300000 confirmed cases and 11000 deaths have been reported from Canada since the start of the pandemic. Mexico reported 42465 new cases this past week (328 new cases per 1 million population), a 16% increase compared to the previous week. There have been reports of increased hospitalizations in the northern state of, this region has been placed under the highest Coronavirus alert level, joining the neighbouring region of Chihuahua, which borders the United States of America. Death rates in the country increased by 9% in the past week, with 3301 new deaths reported.
The incidence of new cases continued to increase in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (Figure 5), with over 238000 new cases this past week, an 11% increase on the previous week, while the number of reported deaths was similar. Countries which reported the greatest number of new cases included Iran, Jordan and Morocco. In Pakistan, a resurgence is being observed with over 12000 (58 cases per 1 million population) new cases reported in the past week – a 45% increase on the previous week. The weekly number of deaths also rose by 21%, with 166 reported. Country officials have strengthened public health and social measures in light of these increases. Considering the large population of Pakistan (over 220 million people), concerted efforts to reduce transmission have thus far been relatively successful. In Afghanistan, a 65% increase was observed this past week, with 1002 new cases (26 cases per 1 million population) reported. As of 12 November, test positivity rates in the country were estimated at over 33%, highlighting the limitations in the testing capacity, testing criteria and willingness of people to come forward for testing, with stigma considered as a major factor in the decision not to get tested. Men accounted for more than 69% of the total confirmed cases, and most recorded deaths were among men aged 50-79 years, which may in part be due to men being over-represented in testing.
Over the past week, the European Region recorded 46% of all cases and 49% of all deaths reported globally, with nearly 2 million new cases and almost 30000 new deaths. However, in the past week, for the first time in over three months, the region observed a decline of 10% in weekly cases (Figure 6). At the same time, deaths continued to increase, with an 18% increase the past week in comparison to the previous week. Varying patterns were seen in Europe with decreases in cases being observed in 24 countries in the past 7 days, ranging from a 2% to over 40% decrease in new cases in these 24 countries compared to the previous week. Whereas in other countries, weekly increases in new cases ranging from 1% to over 40% were reported. The countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week were Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, the Russian Federation, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, Romania, and Austria. Among these ten countries, Austria reported the sharpest increase, with new cases this week 30% higher compared to the previous week. The countries with the highest weekly mortality rates, exceeding 60 deaths per 1 million population, were Czechia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, North Macedonia, Armenia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, France, Croatia and Montenegro. The United Kingdom was the first country in the region to record over 50000 cumulative deaths. The Russian Federation recorded its highest case and death counts, with over 150000 cases (1038 cases per 1 million population) and over 2600 deaths reported in the past week. Public health interventions were strengthened across many regions. Moscow expanded public health and social measures, including switching universities to online learning and limiting the time during which restaurants and bars can serve customers. Lithuania was also among the countries which reached a peak in cases and deaths over the past week, with more than 10500 new cases (3919 cases per 1 million population). Similar to other countries in the region, Lithuania expanded public health and social measures in the first weeks of November. Additionally, Lithuania is adapting its hospital network to meet growing demands through expanding bed capacity and will set up a temporary hospital in a large exhibition center in Vilnius.
The South-East Asia Region observed six weeks of continued decline in cases and deaths from the second half of September until the end of October (Figure 7). New weekly cases fell from over 690000 to around 380000, and new weekly deaths decreased from over 9300 in the week commencing on 14 September to under 4600 in the past week. Since the start of November, weekly cases have stabilized under 400000 for the past three weeks, with 373786 cases reported in the past week. Weekly deaths have also remained relatively stable, with 4534 deaths reported in the past week. Countries with highest number of weekly new cases per million population in the past week included Nepal, Maldives and India. The regional trend continues to be strongly influenced by India, which consistently reports the highest numbers of cases and deaths in the Region. After a period of sharp decline, cases and deaths in India have stabilized since the end of October. In the past week, further decreases of 5% in cases and 12% in deaths were observed, with 306825 cases (222 cases per 1 million population) and 3514 deaths reported. At the end of the week, the states of Maharashtra, Kerala and Delhi reported the highest numbers of new cases, with over 80000 in Maharashtra and almost 40000 in Delhi. Indonesia reported the second highest number of cases in the Region in the past week. Until 8 November, Indonesia had observed a weekly decline in cases for six consecutive weeks, with weekly cases falling from over 30000 in the week commencing on 21 September to under 23800 in the week commencing 2 November. However, in the past week, the country registered over 29000 new cases (107 cases per 1 million population), a 23% increase from last week. Towards the end of the week, Indonesia registered over 5200 daily cases for two consecutive days. On both days, Jakarta and Jawa Tengah Provinces reported the highest case numbers in the country, surpassing 1000 each day.
The number of cases continues to gradually rise in the Western Pacific Region (Figure 8), which reported nearly 33000 new cases and over 400 deaths in the past week. New cases increased by 5% and new deaths increased by 15% compared to the previous week. This reporting period is the second consecutive week that the Western Pacific Region reported more than 30000 new cases per week since mid-September. The Philippines, Japan, Malaysia and French Polynesia reported the highest number of cases in the region. Guam reported 820 new cases (4859 cases per 1 million population) in the past week, more than double the number of cases reported the previous week, and the highest weekly count since the beginning of the pandemic. Four new deaths were reported, bringing the total to 93 cumulative deaths. In a correctional facility, 60 inmates and one officer tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week and are currently in isolation. Malaysia reported 6852 new cases in the past week (212 case per 1 million population). Although the number of cases decreased by 12% compared to the previous week, there has been a general upward trend since the beginning of September. Twenty-four new deaths were reported in the past week, bringing the cumulative total to 306 deaths. Selangor State, which is the most populous state in the country with approximately 19% of the population, reported 28% of cases, followed by Kuala Lumpur which reported 16% of cases. Many cases reported in the past week were linked to previously reported clusters in Sabah State, which reported the highest number of local transmissions, including cases identified by close-contact screenings and existing clusters. In Vanuatu, the first confirmed case was reported on 10 November. The case was a young adult who returned on 4 November from the United States of America. The case, who was asymptomatic, tested positive during routine testing on the fifth day of quarantine. In accordance with the preparedness and response plan, the case will remain in isolation until health clearance is given. Health authorities initiated contact tracing with close contacts, and intensified risk communication and community engagement activities.
This past week, the global acceleration in case incidence has slowed down, with around 4 million new cases reported; however, death rates continue to increase with over 67000 new deaths reported (Figure 1). The European and South East Asia Regions continued downward trends in weekly cases; however, the European Region remains the largest contributor to new cases and new deaths in the past 7 days. The Region of the Americas reported increases in both new cases and new deaths and the Region continues to account for the greatest proportion of cumulative cases and deaths. While cases numbers remain relatively low, the African Region reported the highest increase in new cases (15%) and deaths (30%) this week. The Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions also reported an increase in new cases and deaths this week. As of 22 November there have been over 57.8 million cases and 1.3 million deaths reported globally since the start of the pandemic. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (reporting over 1.1 million cases, a 14% increase from the previous week), India (over 280000 cases, an 8% decrease), Italy (over 230000 new cases, a 3% decrease), Brazil (over 200000 new cases, a 17% increase) and France (over 170000 new cases, a 16% decrease).
In the Region of the Americas, the weekly incidence of new cases reached over 47000 this week with around 1000 new deaths reported, accounting for 15% and 30% relative increases when compared to the previous week, respectively (Figure 3). The highest new case and death counts were reported in South Africa, Algeria and Kenya. In Rwanda this week, cases have increased by 25%, with 226 new cases (17.4 cases per 1 million population) reported. Local authorities are enhancing preventative measures in prisons and detention centres following three outbreaks reported in Kigali, Southern and Eastern provinces. In Zimbabwe, 334 new cases (22.5 cases per 1 million population) were reported this week, with a gradual increase being observed in recent weeks after an initial wave of cases earlier this year. In Matabeleland Northern Province in the North West of the country, there have been reports of a cluster of confirmed cases affecting approximately 100 students at a boarding school, resulting in the closure of the school. Overall, the country has reported over 9000 confirmed cases and nearly 300 deaths. The characteristics of the cases show most cases (57%) occur in those aged 20-40 years with a greater proportion of females in older age groups. Deaths are largely occurring in those aged 40-80 years and males account for a greater percentage of deaths in these age groups.
In the Region of the Americas, the weekly incidence of new cases reached over 1.6 million this week with over 22000 new deaths reported, accounting for 11% and 15% relative increases when compared to the previous week (Figure 4). The majority of these were reported from the United States of America, with over 1.1 million new cases (9918 cases per 1 million population), followed by Brazil and Mexico. Cases in the United States of America continue to rise, showing a 14% increase in the past 7 days, while deaths increased by 23%. The three states reporting the highest number of cases were Illinois, Texas and California. With the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November, many states are implementing additional public health and social measures, and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have discouraged domestic travel. Nonetheless, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened more than 2 million air passengers on 20 and 21 November, in the two days after the federal government issued a travel warning and it is estimated that some 50 million Americans may be travelling this Thanksgiving. On the island of Puerto Rico, relatively low levels of transmission have been sustained over several months with 4600 new cases (91 cases per 1 million population) reported last week. However, weekly deaths have trended upwards in recent weeks, from a low of 26 new deaths/week observed in last October, to 90 new deaths reported last week. The highest numbers of cases in the country have been reported in the Metro, Bayamón and Caguas health regions. Women account for a slightly higher proportion of cases (54%), with an overall median age of 41.5 years. While Argentina currently accounts for the third-highest number of weekly cases (over 62000 new cases, 1745 cases per 1 million population) and deaths (around 3200), both new cases and new deaths have been trending downwards since mid-October. There has however, been a slight increase in cases in eight neighborhoods of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area (Balverna, Boca, Colegiales, Contitucion, Nunez, Palermo, Parque Chacabuco and Vila Urquiza) and cases have stopped decreasing in Cordoba and Rosario; raising concerns that this may signal a broader shift in trend in the coming weeks.
The number of new weekly cases (250746) and deaths (6299) continues to rise in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 5% and 10% higher respectively than the previous week (Figure 5). Since August, the number of new weekly cases and deaths has risen in the Region, when fewer than 80000 new cases and 2500 new deaths were reported per week. Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq and Lebanon reported the highest numbers new cases. The number of new cases in Iraq has declined by 20% over the past week to 16640 cases (1092 cases per 1 million population). The number of weekly new cases has declined since the week of 19 October when there were 25629 new cases. The number of new deaths has also declined steadily and Iraq reported an 11% decline from last week to only 302 deaths. WHO concluded a COVID-19 prevention and awareness campaign that targeted approximately 4 million people, including refugees and internally displaced people in the Kurdistan region. Jordan is reporting 36800 new cases this week, a 1% rise from last week and the second-highest number of incident cases in the Region (after the Islamic Republic of Iran). The number of new weekly cases has continued to increase since August, when there were fewer than 50 cases reported. Jordan has the highest number of new cases per 1 million population in the Region with 3612 new cases per 1 million. Last week nearly half of cases were reported from the capital, Amman, followed by Irbid, Aqaba, and Zarqa. Although most cases have been in the 25-34 age group, around 80% of deaths last week were in those aged 55 and over. Jordan also has the highest number of new deaths per 1 million population in the region with 45.9 deaths per 1 million population. The number of weekly deaths has increased since August, but in the past week declined by 11% to 468 new deaths. The number of new cases in the occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem, increased by 78% last week to 8430 new cases (1652 cases per 1 million population). This represents the highest number of new cases since the pandemic began, and is higher than the previous peak of over 6200 cases reported in the third week of September. Gaza remains a pressing concern as it is ill-equipped to face a major spike in cases due to poor living conditions and a fragile healthcare system.
In the past week, the number of new cases reported in the European Region declined by 6% to 1.77 million, after a decline of 10% in the previous week (Figure 6); in a sign that the re-introduction of stricter public health and social measures in a number of countries over the last few weeks is beginning to slow down transmission. Despite this reduction in new cases, the Region still accounts for 44% of global new cases and 49% of global new deaths. New deaths in the Region have continued to rise with 32684 new deaths reported in the past week. This week, Italy reported the highest number of new cases in the Region and third-highest globally, with 235979 new cases (3902 cases per 1 million population); however, cases may have peaked given the slight (3%) decline reported. The number of new deaths increased by 26% to 4578 new deaths (75 deaths per 1 million population). The northern Italy provinces of Valle d’Aosta, Bolzano and Piemonte report the highest number of cases. Media reports have highlighted concerns of the large number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, and the growing number of health worker infections, straining local healthcare capacities. The number of new cases in the United Kingdom fell by 13% from last week to 149027 new cases (2195 cases per 1 million population), while the number of new deaths remained similar. This decline in new cases represents the first weekly decline since late August. Since 24 August, the number of COVID-19 tests conducted daily has increased from 179000 to 330000 on 13 November (7-day daily average). The number of patients admitted to hospital has also grown from fewer than 100 per day at the end of August, to 1600 on 14 November; however, this is considerably lower than hospitalizations in early April, when there were over 3000 patients admitted daily. The United Kingdom currently has the fifth-highest number of new cases in the European Region, and the eighth highest number worldwide, however, per capita case incidence remains lower than many other countries in the Region. Poland reported 152357 new cases (4026 cases per 1 million population), a 10% fall from last week. The number of new deaths has risen by 35% to 3243 new deaths (or 85 new deaths per 1 million population). Cumulative cases have been highest in the south of Poland, in the provinces of Silesia and Lesser Poland, and in central Poland, in the provinces of Mazowieckie and Greater Poland.
The South-East Asia Region has observed a continued decline in the number of weekly new cases since mid-September with over 351000 cases reported, while the number of weekly new deaths has remained at similar levels over the past four weeks with 4706 deaths (Figure 7). The regional trend is largely driven by the decline in cases in India, which comprises 80% of the Region’s new weekly cases. Countries with the highest number of weekly new cases were India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. In Myanmar, a 74% increase in cases was observed in the past week, with over 11000 new cases (204 cases per 1 million population) reported. The number of total new deaths was 188, a 36% increase compared to the previous week. This trend is a change from the decrease in cases observed since the week commencing 12 October. The government has extended the existing COVID-19 prevention measures until the end of November, including the temporary suspension of international and domestic flights. Health authorities are concerned about a potential increase in cases following gatherings which occurred during the recent election and are closely monitoring the situation. In Sri Lanka, 3580 new cases (167 cases per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, a 29% increase compared to the previous week and the highest number of cases reported in a week since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of new deaths reported was 30, continuing the upward trend in the number of deaths observed in the past five weeks. Due to increasing cases, public health and social measures have been introduced. In the Colombo and Gampaha Districts in Western Province, there are movement restrictions in 18 divisions which will be continued in the coming weeks, as well as in eight districts where restrictions will be lifted this week. In Bangladesh, a gradual increase in the weekly number of cases observed since October continued, with over 14000 new cases (90 cases per 1 million population) in the past week (a 26% increase compared to the previous week). Although there had been a downward trend in deaths since the beginning of September, a 43% increase was reported in the past week with 177 new deaths compared to the previous week. National authorities have closed schools and educational institutions since 17 March. Most school children in Bangladesh do not have access to the internet, so the government is broadcasting lessons on television, and universities are providing classes online. Despite relatively stable testing, the proportion of positive tests has slightly increased over the past month, suggesting an increase in cases and spread of the disease.
Over the past week, the Western Pacific Region recorded over 36000 cases and 439 deaths. The Region observed a continued increase of cases, with a 9% increase compared to the previous week, while deaths remained stable compared to the previous week. Varying patterns of trends were observed in the Region, where countries including Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia and Australia reported an increase in cases compared to the previous week, whereas countries including the Philippines, French Polynesia, Guam, China and Singapore observed a decreasing trend. Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, Republic of Korea and French Polynesia reported the largest number of new weekly reported cases. Japan reported the largest number of daily cases since the beginning of the outbreak with over 2000 cases reported per day for five consecutive days, and 13502 new cases (107 cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week, a 41% increase from the previous week. There has been a resurgence in cases over the past three weeks following a relatively stable number of cases in September and October. The largest number of daily cases to date were observed in prefectures including Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, Osaka and Hokkaido. The COVID-19 alert level in Tokyo Prefecture has been raised to the red level, which is the highest of the four categories. The number of newly reported deaths in the past week was 91, which was an increase by 28%. Mongolia observed a sharp upward trend with 166 new weekly cases (51 cases per 1 million population), following a period of low levels ranging from 0 to 17 weekly cases from July to October. The number reported this week was more than twice the number reported in the previous week. On 11 November, Mongolia reported its first case of COVID-19 transmission in the community. Although there have been many imported cases reported, this case in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar was the first instance of transmission within the country. Two separate clusters were detected soon after in Selenge province which borders the Russian Federation. One of the clusters in Selenge was traced back to an event in early November, which has led to local clusters with linked cases in the provinces of Darkhan-Uul, Govisumber, Orkhon and Dornogovi. Mongolia declared a state of emergency on 12 November. No deaths have been reported in Mongolia since the beginning of the pandemic.
In the past week, global case incidence remained high at approximately 4 million new cases, although a slight downward trend was observed (Figure 1). Weekly deaths, however, continued to rise, with over 69000 new deaths reported globally. The Region of the Americas was the largest contributor for new weekly cases last week. Although the European Region reported a continued decrease in new weekly cases, it still accounts for the second greatest proportion of new weekly cases, while deaths rates have continued to increase and accounted for approximately half of the new global deaths in the past week. The Eastern Mediterranean Region registered a slight decline in both cases and deaths last week, after four months of continued increases. Relatively small increases were reported from the African and South-East Asia Regions, and more substantively from the Western Pacific Region last week. As of 29 November, there have been over 61.8 million cases and over 1.4 million deaths reported globally since the start of the pandemic. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (reporting over 1.1 million cases, a 0.3% increase from the previous week), India (over 297000 cases, a 6% increase), Brazil (over 218000 new cases, a 4% increase), Italy (over 184000 new cases, a 22% decrease) and Russian Federation (over 179000 new cases, a 10% increase).
The African Region reported about 48000 new cases and just under 1000 new deaths last week; a 3% and -10% change from the previous week, respectively (Figure 3). The highest number of new cases and deaths were reported from South Africa (19730 new cases, 333 new cases per 1 million), Algeria (7438 new cases, 170 new cases per 1 million), Kenya (6201 new cases, 115 new cases per 1 million), Ethiopia (3578 new cases, 31 new cases per 1 million), and Uganda (2277 new cases, 50 new cases per 1 million), which collectively account for 81% of all new cases in the Region. For the past three weeks, cases in South Africa have increased by over 20% week-on-week, and last week 19730 new cases were reported (3500 more than the previous week). The rise in new cases in the Western Cape (including in Cape Town) and Eastern Cape provinces is a cause for concern. As of 30 November, Gauteng, the Western Cape, the Eastern Cape, and Kwa-Zulu-Natal provinces have reported 79% of total cumulative cases. Ethiopia reported 3578 new cases (31 new cases per 1 million) and 59 deaths (0.5 new deaths per 1 million) in the past week. The number of new cases being reported from Ethiopia has fallen considerably since a peak at the end of August when there were over 10000 new cases per week. This week the number of new cases rose by 18%, while new deaths fell by 17% from the previous week. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has warned that a full-scale humanitarian crisis is unfolding as thousands of refugees in the Tigray region seek safety in eastern Sudan. At the 70th Session of the WHO Regional Committee for Africa held last week, Ethiopia’s Minister of Health highlighted the need to continue to be vigilant in COVID-19 testing, isolation and treatment, and maintaining strong communication on public health and social measures. Cameroon reported 589 new cases (22 new cases per 1 million) and 2 new deaths (0.1 new deaths per 1 million) in the past week. Since first declaring cases on 6 March, new cases rose to peak at around 2000 cases per week at the end of June and in early July. However, the number of new cases declined in July and have averaged below 400 per week since early August. For the past two weeks cases have risen above this average, with 836 new cases two weeks ago and nearly 600 cases reported this last week. Last week UNHCR warned that as the pandemic continues, a lethal mix of state at home orders, deepening poverty and economic duress is unleashing a wave of violence against refugee, displaced and stateless women and girls. UNHCR report that in North-West and South-West Cameroon where the security situation remains volatile, a staggering 26% of gender-based violence incidents logged since the onset of the pandemic relate to children.
The Region of the Americas reported over 1.6 million new cases and 22000 new deaths, a small increase of 3% and 2%, respectively (Figure 4). The highest number of new cases and deaths were reported from the United States of America (1.15 million new cases, 3476 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (218000 new cases, 1026 new cases per 1 million), Mexico (64000 new cases, 502 new cases per 1 million), Colombia (57000 new cases, 1122 new cases per 1 million), and Argentina (48000 new cases, 1067 new cases per 1 million). These five countries account for 93% of all new cases in the Region. Colombia reported the fourth-highest number of new cases in the Region, with 57000 cases (1122 new cases per 1 million). The number of new deaths increased by 2% from previous week to 1285 new deaths (25.3 new deaths per 1 million). Since the pandemic started, Colombia has seen at least one prominent peak in case incidence in August during which almost 78000 cases per week were reported, followed by a moderate decline; however, the country has sustained over 50000 new cases per week since early October. Bogotá, Amazonas, and Barranquilla have reported the highest case incidence. Among active cases, 70% are at home, 26% in general hospitalization and 3% in intensive care units (ICUs). Men account for 64% of cases, and 77% of those who have died were aged 60 years and over. Colombia has extended its state of emergency by three months. Peru reported 12000 new cases (371 new cases per 1 million) and 355 new deaths (10.8 new deaths per 1 million); decreases of 9% and 6%, respectively from the previous week. Since new cases peaked in the week of 17 August at almost 60000 cases, Peru has observed a consistent decline in cases. Preliminary results of a seroprevalence study in the capital, Lima suggest that around 35% of the population has been infected. To prepare for vaccination activities, 10000 members of the armed forces are being trained to support immunization campaigns. Chile reported 9798 new cases (513 new cases per 1 million) and 292 new deaths (15.3 new deaths per 1 million). New cases in Chile peaked in the week of 15 June with 69000 cases. Since early August, between 9000 – 13000 cases have been reported weekly, with a reported the highest cumulative incidence rates, followed by the Metropolitan, an overall slow rate of decline. The Minister of Health reported that the numbers of hospitalized patients and patients admitted to ICU are also gradually declining. Magallanes Region has and Arica and Parinacota region The Ministry of Health has expressed concerns over increases in some southern regions, such as Los Ríos, Magallanes and La Araucanía. Chile reports that 5 million tests have been conducted, around 1 million tests per month. The Arturo Merino Benítez airport was opened for foreigners last week. An upcoming election was scheduled for 29 November, although people with COVID-19 were not allowed to go to the polls.
After fifteen weeks of steady increases in weekly cases, both new cases (248000) and new deaths (5800) have shown a slight reduction in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, of 1% and 8% respectively compared to the previous week (Figure 5). The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (94500 new cases, 1125 new cases per 1 million), Jordan (32500 new cases, 3200 new cases per 1 million), Morocco (29000 new cases, 780 new cases per 1 million), Pakistan (21000 new cases, 94 new cases per 1 million), and Iraq (15000 new cases, 380 new cases per 1 million). In the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, reported cases and deaths both increased by 43% in the past week, with over 12000 new cases (2368 cases per 1 million) and 93 new deaths (18.2 new deaths per 1 million) reported. This represents the highest number of new cases reported per week in the territory since the outbreak began. The proportion of positive tests has increased slightly over the last three weeks along with an increase in the number of total tests conducted. In the Gaza strip, the current testing strategy is limited to symptomatic patients and their contacts, and a 5% COVID-19 infection rate among health workers. Health services continue to operate with 50% of beds in hospitals and 78% of ICU capacity occupied by COVID-19 patients. The Islamic Republic of Iran continues to report the highest number of incident cases in the Region. The country has experienced an increasing trend in newly reported cases since the end of August with a 3% increase to 94000 new cases (1124 cases per 1 million) in the last week. During this period, the number of weekly new deaths decreased by 4% to 3159 deaths (38 deaths per 1 million). As Iran approaches the 1 million case mark in the coming week, the country is strengthening public health and social measures to curb this trend by introducing curfews and partial movement restrictions based on the number of confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations in respective cities and counties. COVID-19 PCR testing activity has substantially increased from an average of 6 samples/100,000 population/week during August, to 27 samples/100,000/week in the past 4 weeks (totaling over 6 million tests to date); however, positivity rates have also increased over the same period, from ~10% to 32% in the past week.
In the European Region, the number of new cases has been decreasing for three consecutive weeks, since its peak in the first week of November. In the past week, the number of new cases reported declined by 13% to over 1.5 million (Figure 6). Despite this reduction, the Region still accounts for 40% of new global cases and 50% of new global deaths as almost half of the countries within the region continue to show an increasing trend. Last week alone, over 35000 new deaths were reported from the Region, bringing cumulative deaths to 412000. The highest number of new cases were reported from Italy (184000 new cases, 3000 new cases per 1 million), Russian Federation (180000 new cases, 1200 new cases per 1 million), Poland (130000 new cases, 3438 new cases per 1 million), Germany (124000 new cases, 1500 new cases per 1 million), and the United Kingdom (112000 new cases, 1647 new cases per 1 million). In Turkey, upward trends in both cases and deaths have continued over the past week, with over 47000 new cases (560 new cases per 1 million) and just over 1150 new deaths (14 new deaths per 1 million) reported. The country saw a 58% increase in new cases in the past week, with rising numbers previously seen mainly in Istanbul, Izmir and Bursa having now spread throughout the country. There have been concerted efforts to increase testing capacity following an upward trend in reported cases during the summer holiday period. To date, over 18.2 million tests have been conducted with a 3% positivity rate in the past week. Serbia has reported a steady increase in the weekly number of cases and deaths since October. In the past week, 46910 new cases (6700 new cases per 1 million) and 300 new deaths (45 new deaths per 1 million population) were reported. The country has conducted over 1.7 million tests to date, including around 137000 people tested in the past week (20 tests/1000 population/week), of which 34% were positive. With over 7200 patients hospitalized and more than 250 on ventilation support at the end of last week, a clinic in the country will be converted into a COVID-19 hospital to provide intensive care and oxygen support to cope with the increase in number of cases requiring clinical care. In Greece, after several weeks of an upward trend, cases have decreased by 27% with 12913 new cases (1239 new cases per 1 million) reported. Whereas, a steep increase in the number of deaths continues, with 696 new deaths reported (67 new deaths per 1 million) in the past week. This number accounts for one third of the total deaths reported since the beginning of the outbreak. As the current situation is challenging the national health system, plans are underway to strengthen it at the national level and in the most affected areas in Thessaloniki, which is located in northern Greece, by ensuring that every patient receives the health care needed though hiring more health workers and increasing ICU capacity.
In the South-East Asia Region, new weekly cases remained at similar levels as the previous four weeks with 371180 cases reported in the past week. The trend in cases is largely driven by the number of cases in India, which reported 80% of new weekly cases in the Region. A decrease in new weekly cases was observed in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, whereas an increase was reported from Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand and Bhutan. There were 4888 deaths reported from seven countries in the past week, a 4% increase compared to the previous week. The highest number of new cases were reported from India (297000 new cases, 215 new cases per 1 million), Indonesia (35000 new cases, 127 new cases per 1 million), Bangladesh (15000 new cases, 93 new cases per 1 million), Nepal (12000 new cases, 415 new cases per 1 million) and Myanmar (8800 new cases, 161 new cases per 1 million). In India, 297113 new cases (215 per 1 million population) were reported in the past week. Since cases peaked in the week commencing 14 September, weekly decreases in new cases have continued. There were 3469 deaths reported in the past week, a 3% decrease compared to the previous week, but the number of weekly deaths has remained relatively stable since late October. As of 27 November, 70% of active cases were reported from eight states and union territories, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Maharashtra has been the most affected state in terms of the number of cases and deaths reported. In Delhi, the number of new cases has decreased from 46876 cases in the week commencing 9 November to 36785 cases in the past week. State governments including Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan have implemented night curfew in selected areas. In Indonesia, 34691 new cases (127 per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, bringing the cumulative cases to over half a million cases. A total of 872 new deaths were reported, a 39% increase compared to the previous week. Cases have been confirmed in 505 out of 514 districts and municipalities across all 34 provinces. As of 22 November, the test positivity rate in Indonesia was 14%. In Jakarta, local authorities extended public health and social measures for two additional weeks. In 98 referral hospitals in Jakarta, the average bed occupancy has increased from 56% to 73%, and the ICU occupancy has increased from 60% to 70% (591 of 841 beds occupied) in the past two weeks.
In the past week, the number of new cases reported in the Western Pacific Region increased by 12% with 40550 cases, continuing the increase since the beginning of November (Figure 8). The number of weekly cases is lower than the highest peak observed in the Region in the week commencing 3 August. The number of deaths in the past week remained at similar levels compared to the previous two weeks with 445 deaths reported from eight countries including the Philippines and Japan which together comprised 87% of all deaths. The highest number of new cases were reported from Japan (14500 new cases, 114 new cases per 1 million), Philippines (11000 new cases, 100 new cases per 1 million), Malaysia (9500 new cases, 293 new cases per 1 million), Republic of Korea (3000 new cases, 60 new cases per 1 million) and French Polynesia (1100 new cases, 4000 new cases per 1 million). The Philippines reported 10945 cases (100 cases per 1 million) in the past week; a similar level to the previous week. The overall trend shows a gradual decrease since its peak in late July to early August. The country reported 253 new deaths in the past week, a 12% decrease compared to the previous week, although the Philippines has reported the highest cumulative deaths in the Region with 8333 deaths. As of 25 November, 55% of cumulative cases were male, and the most affected age group was 20 to 29 years (27%) followed by 30 to 39 years (24%). Out of 8215 confirmed deaths, 60% were male, with the most affected age group aged over 70 (34.5%) followed by 60 to 69 years (27.3%). The National Capital Region, which surrounds Manila, has reported 46% of cumulative cases, followed by Calabarzon Region (18%) in the south-east of Manila. National authorities have conditionally approved ending restrictions on Filipino healthcare workers to take up employment outside of the Philippines and are developing a contingency plan to rapidly respond to a possible surge following the upcoming holiday season. The Republic of Korea reported 3091 new weekly cases (60 cases per 1 million), a sharp 41% increase compared to the previous week, reaching the highest weekly case count since early March. A total of 18 new weekly deaths were reported; in comparison, less than 20 deaths/week have been reported since late September. Sources of infections have diversified since the start of the pandemic, and younger groups are now at the center of the spread. Clusters have been traced to military facilities, educational institutions, sporting facilities, healthcare facilities, gatherings among friends, among others. In Seoul, the five-tier physical-distancing rules have been raised to the third-highest level amid rising cases in the metropolitan area. The government urged students to stop attending “cram schools” and private lessons ahead of college entrance exams in early December. In French Polynesia, 1118 new cases were reported in the past week, a 12% decrease compared to the previous week, continuing a downward trend since the week commencing 9 November. Incidence is decreasing in Tahiti and other islands. Ten new deaths were reported in the past week, similar to the the previous week. While there are currently no national movement restrictions implemented, a curfew was introduced in October and there are inter-island movement restrictions in place.
The global incidence of new cases remained very similar to the previous week with just under 4 million new cases reported in the past seven days, while new deaths, globally, increased slightly to over 73000 new deaths reported. New cases and deaths in the Region of the Americas account for nearly half of all new cases and over one third of all new deaths this week. While new cases remain high in the European Region, new deaths have decreased for a second week. New cases declined in South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions this week. Deaths decreased in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and increased in the South-East Asia Region. In the African Region, while both new cases and deaths remain low compared to other regions, there was an increase of 9% in new cases. New deaths have remained stable over the past few weeks. In the Western Pacific Region, cases showed a small decline overall while new deaths increased slightly this week. As of 7 December there have been over 65.8 million cases and over 1.5 million deaths reported since the start of the pandemic. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (reporting over 1.2 million cases, a 9% increase from the previous week), Brazil (over 295000 new cases, a 35% increase), India (over 251000 cases, a 15% decrease), Russian Federation (over 191000 new cases, a 6% increase) and Italy (over 145000 new cases, a 21% decrease).
In the past seven days, over 53000 new cases were reported in the African Region, a 9% increase compared to the previous week, while deaths remained similar to last week’s at just under 1000 new reported deaths (Figure 3). South Africa continues to account for the greatest proportion (48%) of new weekly cases in the Region. In the past seven days, the highest number of new cases was reported from South Africa (25310 new cases, 427 new cases per 1 million population), Algeria (6290 new cases, 143 new cases per 1 million population), Kenya (5379 new cases, 100 per 1 million population), Ethiopia (3810 new cases, 33 new cases per 1 million population) and Uganda (2244 new cases, 49 per 1 million population). Over the past month, Kenya has reported its highest weekly cases and deaths. However, in the past week these numbers have declined by 13% and 8%, respectively, for both new cases and deaths. Case totals in the country have reached nearly 88000 since the start of the pandemic and, with fatalities only being reported for hospital deaths, it is likely that cumulative deaths are being underreported. A study in July reported that for a country of 51 million people, there are only 537 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and 256 ventilators. Nearly 75% of Kenya's ICU beds are in Nairobi and Mombasa. Thus far Kenya has conducted nearly 886000 tests with a testing rate of 1.2 per 1000 population in the last week and a test positivity rate of 10%. Cases in Nigeria have increased by 46% in the past seven days, the highest weekly case count reported since August. In the past seven days, 22 of the 37 states in Nigeria have reported new cases with the highest case numbers being reported in the states of Lagos, Federal Capital Territory, Plateau, Oyo and Kaduna. In a country of over 206 million persons, Nigeria has conducted over 803000 tests throughout the pandemic. In the last reporting week, it had a testing rate of 0.17 per 1000 population and a test positivity rate of 4.6% Additionally, while the volume of in-bound international travel in the past week has remained within its normal parameters, the number of travelers with a positive result after seven days has increased by 68% (from 48 to 81).
In the Region of the Americas, the weekly number of new cases reached 1845816 this week with 26624 new deaths, accounting for 12% and 18% increases compared to the previous week, respectively (Figure 4). The United States of America accounted for 68% of all new cases reported in the past week in the Region. The highest new case and deaths counts were reported in the United States of America (1251632 new cases, 3781 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (295618 new cases, 1391 new cases per 1 million), Mexico (66095 new cases, 513 new cases per 1 million), Columbia (62097 new cases, 1220 new cases per 1 million) and Argentina (47354 new cases, 1048 new cases per 1 million). In Brazil, a 35% increase in cases was observed in the past week, with 295618 new cases (1391 cases per 1 million population), which was the highest number reported since mid-August. Upwards trends are being observed in all five regions, and to date, the Southeast Region, which includes the state of Sao Paulo, has reported the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths, followed by the Northeast Region. The number of new deaths was 3990, a 19% increase compared to the previous week. On 1 December, the government of Paraná in southern Brazil, which borders Paraguay and Argentina, introduced a night curfew. In Mexico, 66095 new cases (513 cases per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, a 2% increase compared to the previous week and the highest weekly case count since the beginning of the pandemic. There were 3990 new deaths reported, similar levels to the previous week. The government is urging citizens to stay home, and is planning to add hospital beds, medical equipment, and increase the number of doctors and nurses ahead of the holiday season. The number of new cases in Canada continues to increase with 43505 reported (1153 cases per 1 million population), a 13% increase from the previous week reaching the highest weekly number since the beginning of the pandemic. Six hundred and two new deaths were reported in the past week, a 7% increase compared to the previous week. In Manitoba province, which reported the fifth highest number of COVID-19 cases in Canada, outbreaks have been reported in a children’s daycare center, at a hospital and at a care home in recent weeks. The province of Quebec plans to prohibit gatherings over the holidays in the maximum alert "red zones", which covers most of the state, as a result of the recent upward trend in cases.
For the second consecutive week, both new cases and new deaths have declined. The Eastern Mediterranean Region reported over 240000 new cases and over 5000 new deaths, reflecting a reduction of 2% and 12% respectively compared to the previous week (Figure 5). Increases in both new weekly cases and new weekly deaths were reported in Afghanistan, Egypt, occupied Palestinian territory, Oman and Somalia. The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (93187 new cases, 1109 new cases per 1 million), Morocco (27050 new cases, 733 new cases per 1 million), Jordan (26804 new cases, 2627 new cases per 1 million), Pakistan (20835 new cases, 94 new cases per 1 million) and Iraq (13699 new cases, 341 new cases per 1 million). In Lebanon, over 10000 new cases (1500 per 1 million population) were reported in the past week. Since cases peaked in the beginning of November, small weekly decreases in new cases have been reported. Ninety-nine new deaths were reported this week compared to the 97 reported in the previous week. National health authorities stated on 3 December that ICUs for COVID-19 patients remain at critical capacity. Before the strengthening of public health and social measures (PHSM) came into effect in mid-November, the occupancy of ICU beds ranged between 80 and 90%.  As an effect of these measures being implemented, occupancy has declined to the range of 65 and 70%. Despite the high occupancy in healthcare facilities, Lebanon has seen a decreasing trend in new cases and the country is gradually relaxing PHSM by reopening restaurants, postponing curfews and returning to face-to-face classes in some schools. Morocco continued to show a decreasing trend in the past week, reporting a decrease of 6% in weekly new cases and 8% in weekly new deaths compared to the figures in the past week. The country reported over 27000 new cases (733 cases per 1 million population) and over 400 new deaths (12 deaths per 1 million population). Since its peak of cases in mid-November, Morocco has shown a decreasing trend in cases for three consecutive weeks. National health authorities inaugurated a new field hospital in the region of Souss-Massa this week and established new hospital projects for treating COVID-19 patients planned for 2021 in the region of Rabat-Salé-Kenitrar. Since mid-October, cases in Egypt have increased. In the current week, the country reported over 2800 new cases, a 13% increase compared to the past week (28 cases per 1 million population). As Egypt experiences a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, the country is strengthening public health and social measures by reducing the working hours for shops and limiting the number of employees and workers in government offices.
The number of new cases in the European Region remains high with over 1.4 million new cases reported in the past week (Figure 6). However, the number of new cases has has declined again, in line with the past four weeks, down 10% in comparison to the last seven days. While deaths also decreased in the Region in the past seven days, there were still almost 35200 deaths reported. Despite the observed reductions, the European Region continues to account for the second highest number of new cases and deaths globally (37% and 48% respectively). Last week, the countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the Russian Federation (191454 new cases, 1312 new cases per 1 million population), Italy (145459 new cases, 2406 new cases per 1 million population), Germany (128622 new cases, 1535 new cases per 1 million population) and the United Kingdom (100799 new cases, 1485 per 1 million population). In Germany, the weekly number of new cases have remained relatively unchanged compared to the previous week (3% increase), while the number of deaths has increased by 26%. An increase in both cases and deaths was seen in early October, which then seemed to have plateaued in the latter half of November. While the incidence in younger ages remains stable, it continues to increase in older age groups with an incidence of cases of 128 per 100000 population in those aged 60 years and over. The distribution of cases and deaths varies across the country with the state of North-Rhine Westphalia consistently reporting the highest number of cases, while deaths are highest in Bavaria (30.9 per 100000 population). The United Kingdom continues to report high numbers of new cases and deaths, although overall incidence have decreased for the past three weeks. The country introduced tighter public health and social measures on 5 November. It has conducted nearly 39 million tests since the start of the pandemic. In the past week, the testing rate has been 29 tests per 1000 population with a test positivity rate of 5.8%. On 2 December, the United Kingdom became the first country to approve Pfizer/BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, with the first doses to be administered on 8 December. Vaccines will be available to about 70 hospital hubs across the country, and provided first to those aged over 80 years and health care workers.
In the South-East Asia Region, new cases reported last week declined 10% compared to the previous week (332396 new cases, 164 new cases per 1 million population), although new weekly deaths showed a slight increase of 2% compared to the previous week (5004 new deaths, 2 new deaths per 1 million population) (Figure 7). The trends in cases and deaths are still largely driven by India, which reported 76% and 70% of new weekly cases and deaths respectively in the Region. A decrease in new weekly cases was reported in India, Nepal and the Maldives, whereas an increase was reported from Bhutan, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The highest number of new cases were reported from India (251303 new cases, 182 new cases per 1 million), Indonesia (41708 new cases, 152 new cases per 1 million) and Bangladesh (15260 new cases, 93 new cases per 1 million). In Nepal, over 9000 new cases (314 per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, a significant decrease of 24% compared to the previous week. In addition, the number of new deaths decreased by 17%, to 123 new deaths (4 deaths per 1 million population). As of 2 December, 77% of cases were reported from three provinces, Province 1, Bagmati province and Lumbini province. National authorities inaugurated 5 provincial infectious diseases hospitals and 309 basic hospitals at the municipal level across the country. In addition, health authorities are working with Kathmandu Municipality, one of the hardest hit areas, to institutionalize community based active surveillance and testing. In Bangladesh, new weekly cases and deaths remained at similar levels as the previous week, with over 15000 new cases (93 new cases per 1 million population) and 227 new deaths (1 death per 1 million population) reported in this week. As of 30 November, the bed occupancy rate for general beds and ICUs were 17.4% and 56.2% respectively, according to national health authorities. Moreover, on 5 December, the country started a new testing strategy, introducing the antigen rapid detection test (Antigen-RDT) in 10 of the 64 districts (Jashore, Brahmanbaria, Gaibandha, Joyupurhat, Madaripur, Meherpur, Munshiganj, Panchagarh, Patuakhali, and Sylhet). Among the samples tested, the proportion of infection detected by Antigen-RDT was 26.5%. The country will be gradually expanding antigen-based testing in areas where PCR testing is currently not implemented.
Last week, in the Western Pacific Region, the weekly incidence of new cases was 40039, with 461 new deaths, accounting for a 1% decrease in cases and a 4% increase in deaths compared to the previous week (Figure 8). Countries including the Republic of Korea and China reported an upward trend in weekly new cases, while countries including Malaysia, Guam and Mongolia reported a downward trend compared to the previous week. The highest new case and deaths counts were reported in Japan (15445 new cases, 122 new cases per 1 million), Philippines (10272 new cases, 94 new cases per 1 million) and Malaysia (8183 new cases, 253 new cases per 1 million). In Malaysia, 8183 new weekly cases were reported, a 14% decrease compared to the previous week, but the levels continue to remain high since the rise of cases in September. The number of new weekly deaths reported were 26, an 18% increase compared to the previous week, but overall the trend continues to decline since death counts peaked in mid-to-late October. Sabah state has reported the highest number of cumulative cases, followed by Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Negeri Sembilan states. Among the new cases reported in the past week, there were cases linked to clusters in prisons and temporary detention centers in Kedah, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Sabah and Penang states. In addition to correctional facilities, clusters have also been identified in construction sites, factories and other workplaces, as well as in family settings. China reported 831 cases (1 per 1 million population) in the past week, a 22% increase compared to the previous week, though cases remain at low levels. New weekly cases last exceeded 800 in the week commencing 27 July. Three deaths were reported in the past week.
In the past week the number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continued to rise with 70 million cumulative cases and 1.6 million deaths globally since the start of the pandemic. The Regions of the Americas and Europe continue to shoulder the burden of the pandemic, accounting for 85% of new cases and 86% of new deaths globally. However as new cases and new deaths continue to rise in the Americas, in cases stabilised in Europe for the third week in a row, while deaths continued to decrease. The African and the Western-Pacific Regions have both shown renewed rises in November and December. This week the African Region reported a rise in new cases and new deaths of over 40% compared with the previous week. In the South-East Asia Region, the number of new cases and deaths continued to decline following a peak in September. The Eastern Mediterranean Region also reported a decline in new cases and deaths from a peak in mid-November. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases globally were the United States of America (reporting over 1.4 million cases, a 16% increase from the previous week), Brazil (300000 new cases, a 2% increase), Turkey (220000 cases, no change from last week), India (210000 cases, a 15% decrease), and the Russian Federation (193000 new cases, a 1% increase).
Following a decline in July and August and a plateau in September and October, the number of new cases and deaths has consistently increased since the beginning of November (Figure 3). In the last week, the number of new cases and deaths reported increased by 40% (to 74500 new cases) and 43% (to 1400 new deaths), respectively compared with the previous week. Several countries in the Region are reporting a resurgence in both cases and deaths including Mali, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal and South Africa. South Africa has reported the highest number of cumulative cases and deaths in the Region, with more than 850000 confirmed cases and over 23000 deaths. In the last week, 42500 new cases (700 new cases per 1 million population) and 1000 new deaths (18 new deaths per 1 million population) were reported. Four provinces including Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape were most heavily affected, collectively accounting for 84% of all newly reported cases. The increase in affected provinces is expected to continue as the number of cases among those aged 15 to 19 years continues to increase. This increase could be partly attributed to end-of-school-year celebrations during which many adolescents gathered in large numbers. In Uganda, the number of reported cases has continued to increase and in the last seven days, just under 5000 cases were reported (100 new cases per 1 million population), a 118% increase from the previous week. The districts of Kampala, Kasese, Luwero, Mbarara and Wakiso have consistently reported the highest number of cases for the past three weeks, with Kampala the most affected. So far in the pandemic, a total of 1516 cases, including 13 deaths, have been reported among health care workers, with the highest number reported in the week commencing 23 November, during which over 150 cases in health care workers were reported.
The Region of the Americas has consistently reported the largest proportion of cases and deaths globally, and in the past week accounted for 47% and 40% of global cases and deaths respectively. In the past week, over 2 million cases and nearly 30000 deaths were reported, which is the highest reported in the Region since the start of the pandemic. This represents an 11% increase in cases and a 12% increase in deaths compared to the previous week. Last week, the United States of America reported an increase of 16% in cases (1.45 million new cases, 4400 new cases per 1 million population) and a 21% increase in deaths (16600 new deaths, 50 new deaths per 1 million population), compared to the previous week, as cases continue to rise after the Thanksgiving holiday in November. The daily number of deaths reported exceeded 3000 during the last week, higher than the peak observed in the spring. Further increases in cases and deaths are expected due to the upcoming holiday season with more people travelling into and around the country. Hospitalization rates for COVID-19 cases have grown considerably since the beginning of October. Kentucky, Georgia, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas are the most affected, with counties reporting high hospital occupancy rates. Bermuda has reported a cumulative total of nearly 400 cases and nine deaths since the start of the pandemic. However, since the beginning of December, the number of cases has increased substantially. In the last week, 103 new cases were reported (1650 new cases per 1 million population) a 150% increase from the previous week. Approximately 30% of the total number of cases have been imported. Visitors are not required to quarantine on arrival if they provide a valid negative COVID-19 test taken at least five days before arrival. Due to the rapid rise in cases, public health and social measures were implemented on 12 December including a curfew, early closure of businesses, and restrictions on gatherings. Uruguay has reported a 48% increase in the number of new cases to 2100 new cases (610 new cases per 1 million population) and a 67% increase in the number of deaths to 10 new deaths (3 new deaths per 1 million) in comparison to previous week. The test positivity rate has also increased in the last couple of weeks and is currently 5.1%. The capital, and largest city in Uruguay, Montevideo is the most affected area accounting for over 60% of cases.
Compared with the previous reporting week, this week the Region reported a 17% decline in new cases to just over 200000 cases and a 14% decline in new deaths to 4400 deaths. This extends the decline observed since mid-November when new cases peaked at around 250000 and new deaths at just over 6000. The Islamic Republic of Iran, Pakistan, Morocco, Jordan, and the occupied Palestinian territory reported the highest number of cases, although all these countries except Pakistan reported declines in the number of new cases in the past week. Pakistan reported 22000 new cases (99 new cases per 1 million population) and 420 new deaths (2 new deaths per 1 million population). New weekly cases have risen since the week of 19 October, when 4000 cases were reported. This week’s new cases and deaths represent a 5% and 17% rise respectively compared to last week. Since the beginning of the pandemic, as of 6 December, Pakistan had conducted 5.7 million COVID-19 tests, with a current positivity rate of 7.5%. The Sindh and Punjab Regions account for around 73% of total cases, with around half of current active cases reported from the Sindh Region. The United Arab Emirates reported 8500 new cases (850 new cases per 1 million population) and 20 new deaths (2 new deaths per 1 million population). New cases per week have remained above 8000 since 12 October. The United Arab Emirates is the first country to approve a vaccine produced by Sinopharm, based in China. In the next few weeks, Abu Dhabi is planning to further open the business, tourism and cultural sectors. Tunisia reported 7400 new cases (620 new cases per 1 million population) and 310 new deaths (26 new deaths per 1 million population). Similar to the United Arab Emirates, new cases per week have also remained high since the end of September and October, with more than 7000 new weekly cases reported. Since the beginning of the pandemic, as of 6 December, 480000 tests have been conducted, with a current positivity rate of 30%. National authorities have announced an extension to the night curfew until the end of the year.
The number of new cases continued to stabilise for the third consecutive week in the European Region. There was also a decline in reported deaths for the second consecutive week, a decrease of 4% compared to the previous week. The number of new deaths reported this week, particularly in eastern and southern countries of the European Region, exceeded 60 per 1 million, the highest globally. In the past week, some countries have announced initial vaccination in the population, while others are preparing for the introduction of the vaccine. Despite this, it is important that public health and social measures, including hand hygiene, mask wearing, physical distancing and adequate ventilation, along with other measures, continue. The Russian Federation reported 193000 new cases (1300 new cases per 1 million population), the second highest number of cases in the European Region after Turkey, and 3800 new deaths (26 new deaths per 1 million population). The two most populous cities in the country, Moscow and St Petersburg, together with the Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod regions, are reporting the highest numbers of new cases. Since the first cases on 31 January, over 2.6 million cases and 46000 deaths have now been reported - the fourth highest global total cases. The number of new cases and new deaths has increased over five-fold since the last week of August, when 33500 new cases and 700 new deaths were reported. In the past week, 23 tests per 1000 population were conducted resulting in a test positivity rate of around 6%. Serbia reported 47500 new cases (6800 new cases per 1 million population) and 380 new deaths (55 new deaths per 1 million population). This was a slight decrease in new cases from the previous week during which over 50000 new cases were reported. The number of cases has rapidly increased since September, when there were around 500 new cases per week. The percentage of COVID-19 tests that are positive has increased from less than 10% in September to over 30% last week during which 19 tests per 1000 population were conducted. Sweden reported 32000 new cases (3200 new cases per 1 million population) and 128 new deaths (13 new deaths per 1 million population). New weekly cases have remained above 30000 since 9 November. However, there was a substantial decrease in deaths reported this week with a 62% decrease compared to the previous week.
In the South-East Asia Region, new cases reported (290000) showed a 13% decline from the previous week and continued the general pattern of decreasing cases since early September. New deaths (4400) decreased 12% in the past week, following a 3 week increase. Only three out of ten countries in the region (Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand) reported an increase in new cases this week. While India has consistently reported the highest number of cases and deaths in the Region, declining trends in both have been seen over the past month, with that trend continuing this week. The country reported decreases in both new cases (213000, a 15% decrease) and new deaths (2800, a 19% decrease) compared with the previous week. A recent study found that very few deaths were recorded in long-term care facilities across the three western Indian states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, states that are among some of the most affected by the pandemic. India has conducted over 153 million tests since the start of the pandemic with 4.9 tests per 1000 population conducted in the previous week and a test positivity rate of around 3.2%. In Indonesia, the trend in increasing new cases and deaths reported in the past 5 weeks, continued last week. While there was a very minor increase in the number of new cases (42000, a 1% increase), the number of new deaths reported this week increased by 13% (to just over 1000). In the week ending 6 December just 0.89 tests per 1000 population were conducted with a test positivity rate of 14.2%, suggesting the need to expand testing to ensure all cases are being detected. The highest number of cumulative cases is seen in the provinces of DKI Jakarta, Jawa Timur and Jawa Tengah.
Although cases and deaths in the region still continue to account for a very small proportion of the global total, a 13% increase in the number of new weekly cases (45000) and a 16% increase in new weekly deaths (500) was observed in the past 7 days in the Western Pacific Region. With the exception of a slight decrease last week, this follows an increasing trend over the past six weeks. There are considerable regional differences, with around half of countries reporting decreases and half reporting increases in cases (notably Japan, Malaysia, and the Republic of Korea). Japan continues to report the highest number of weekly new cases in the Region and this week reported record highs (17200 cases, 136 new cases per 1 million), following increases over the previous eight weeks. In an effort to reduce increasing cases and demands on healthcare, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) have sent health workers to Asahikawa city in Hokkaido Prefecture. Osaka prefecture has also requested additional support in healthcare capacity from the JSDF as it is the second most affected prefecture following Tokyo . In the previous week Japan conducted 1.9 tests per 1000 population with a test positivity rate of over 6%. This is the fifth consecutive week the Republic of Korea has reported an increase in new cases, reaching the highest total of new weekly cases (5200). The provinces reporting the highest incidence are Seoul and Gyeonggi-do. As a result of these increases, tighter public health and social measures in the Capital area have been implemented until the end of the year. In the past week, hospital bed shortages in the Seoul area have also been reported, with only 3 out of 62 hospital beds for critically ill patients in Seoul city currently available.
New COVID-19 cases and deaths continued to increase during the past week, by 6% and 4% respectively (Figure 1, Table 1). The Region of the Americas again accounted for the greatest proportion, reporting over 2.3 million new cases (half of the global cumulative), while the European Region reported the highest number of new deaths (36286; 46%) in the past week. The African Region accounted for the greatest relative increase in new cases (27%) and deaths (34%) compared to the previous week. Increasing trends were also observed in the Western Pacific Region, while the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean Regions were the only two that reported a decrease in both cases and deaths. On 14 December 2020, authorities from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) reported a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 to WHO. It was identified by viral genomic sequencing, and is referred to as SARS-CoV-2 Variant Under Investigation, year 2020, month 12, variant 01 (SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01). Initial analysis indicates that the variant may spread more readily between people. Investigations are ongoing to determine if it is associated with any change in the severity of infection, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. As of 20 December there have been over 75 million cases and over 1.6 million deaths since the start of the pandemic. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases globally were the United States of America with over 1.6 million cases, a 14% increase from the previous week, Brazil (326751 new cases, an 8% increase from the previous week), Turkey (194476 new cases, an 11% decrease from the previous week), the Russian Federation (194449 new cases; less than a 1% increase from the previous week) and India (174194 new cases; an 18% decrease from the previous week).
The African Region has continued to report a steady increase in new reported cases and deaths, with 27% and 34% increases respectively week on week. (Figure 3). The Region reported 94653 new cases, constituting the highest overall change in case counts (Table 1). The number of new cases per 1 million population was 84 during the last week and a case fatality rate of 2.2%, since the start of the pandemic. The highest number of cases were reported from South Africa (59512, 1003 new cases per 1 million population), Nigeria (5176, 25 new cases per 1 million population), Ethiopia (4134, 36 cases per 1 million population), Kenya (3846, 72 cases per 1 million population), Uganda (3631, 79 cases per 1 million population) and Algeria (3143, 72 cases per 1 million population). South Africa continues to report high numbers of new cases and deaths, and has the highest case incidence (1003 new cases per 1 million population) within the region. As of 20 December 2020, the cases were mainly distributed in Gauteng (28%), Western Cape (19%), Eastern Cape (17%) and KwaZulu Natal (17%) provinces. New stay-at-home orders were implemented, as well as closures of some public beaches and parks, limiting alcohol selling hours and a curfew from 11pm to 4am. A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in South Africa and the changes observed may translate to higher transmissibility. New cases reported in Eswatini have increased by 170%, bringing the cumulative to 7305 cases. The country reported an increased incidence of 509 new cases per million population compared to 189 cases per million population reported in the previous week. As of 14 December 2020, cases were mainly distributed in regions of Manzini (46%) and Hhohho (38%), according to the Ministry of Health. Reported deaths increased, though cumulative deaths remain low (137 deaths) compared to neighbouring countries, South Africa and Mozambique.
The Region of the Americas reported over 2.3 million new cases this week, a 13% increase from the previous week (Figure 4). The Region also reported over 32000 deaths, a 9% increase from the previous week and a continuation in the a rapid rise in deaths since November. The United States of America continues to report an increasing number of new cases (over 1.65 million new cases; over 5000 new cases per 1 million population) – the highest incidence in the Region. The United States of America is followed by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Canada in cases reported last week. The five countries with the highest number of deaths per 1 million population were Belize (75 deaths per 1 million), the United States of America (54 deaths per 1 million), Panama (45 deaths per million), Mexico (33 deaths per 1 million), and Colombia (27 deaths per 1 million). The number of new cases reported last week in Argentina (over 42000, 930 per 1 million population) represents a 21% increase from last week and pushes the cumulative number of cases above 1.5 million. This is the first increase in the number of new cases since a continuous downward trend from the week of 19 October, when new weekly cases peaked at 103000. Despite this increase in new cases, the number of new deaths continued to decline, to just over 1000 new deaths reported last week, a 3% decline compared to the previous week. Buenos Aires province has reported the highest number of cumulative cases and accounts for 43% of cases, followed by the province of Santa Fé, the city of Buenos Aires and Córdoba province. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 4.3 million cumulative people have been tested, with a current test positivity rate of 30%. The occupancy rate of intensive care beds stands at 54%. The number of new cases reported by Panama has risen rapidly since the week of 9 November. Last week, a 31% rise was seen compared to the previous week, with 18500 new cases reported (4300 new cases per 1 million population – the second highest in the Region after the United States of America). The number of new deaths has also risen by 26% in comparison to the previous week, with 195 new deaths reported (45 new deaths per 1 million population). Public health and social measures including curfews are being implemented over the end-of-year holiday period. The government has approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19 and expects to start receiving the first batch in the first quarter of 2021. In the Dominican Republic, new cases reported stabilized during the last week, to just under 5500 new cases (500 new cases per 1 million), an 8% decline from last week. As of 13 December, 790000 polymerase chain- reaction (PCR) tests had been conducted, with a current test positivity rate around 15%. Around 30% of COVID-19 intensive care unit beds are currently occupied. Of those who have died, one third were reported to have hypertension, while 21% were diabetic, according to authorities. As with Panama, curfews will be implemented over the end-of-year holiday period.
The number of new cases and deaths in the Eastern Mediterranean Region has decreased, for the fourth consecutive week (Figure 5). A cumulative 174325 new cases (a 14% decrease compared to the previous week) and 3852 new deaths (a 12% decrease compared to the previous week) was reported in the past week. The countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the past week were the Islamic Republic of Iran (51254 new cases; 610 new cases per 1 million population), Pakistan (19617 new cases; 89 new cases per 1 million population) and Morocco (17629 new cases; 478 per 1 million population). These three countries also accounted for the most deaths reported in the past week (table 2). There has been a 40% increase in new cases in the Syrian Arab Republic in the past week, with over 1000 cases reported, while the number of new deaths increased by nearly 50%. Increases in new cases have been reported for the past eight weeks, and the case fatality rate is high, at just under 6%. In Lebanon the number of new cases has increased by 20%, after five weeks of reporting decreases. The number of new deaths decreased by 21%. Most cases were male (54%) compared to female (46%), and the highest incidence per 100000 population was reported in those aged 50-59 years since the start of the pandemic. Nationally, the cumulative incidence has been reported to be highest in the district of Aleyh (5121 per 100000 population), while the incidence in the past 14 days has been highest in the district of Zahleh (655 per 100000 population). A new COVID-19 department was opened in the Othman Hospital in Kutermaya -- Al-Kharroub region of Lebanon -- along with an increase in the number of beds and intensive care units in two other hospitals: Al-Koura Hospital and Shaheen Hospital. Both cases and deaths continued to increase in Egypt during the last week. The number of cases increased by 24%, representing the largest relative increase reported in the past two months. The number of new deaths increased by 16%. There was a cluster of cases reported among the youth national football team. The Minister of Health stated early in December that 56% of intensive care unit beds and 30% of ventilators are currently occupied, while the occupancy of beds for isolation is 24%. In an effort to address the rising number of cases and deaths, a grant will be used to scale up medical supplies.
The increase in the number of new cases (2%) and deaths (3%) reported last week in the European Region remained very similar to the previous week (Figure 6). The highest number accounting for 33% of all cases reported in the Region, were in Turkey (194476 new cases; 2306 new cases per 1 million population), the Russian Federation (194449 new cases; 1332 new cases per 1 million population) and Germany (173293 new cases; 2068 new cases per 1 million population). The highest number of new deaths were reported in Italy (4411 new deaths; 73 new deaths per 1 million population), Germany (4262 new deaths; 51 new deaths per 1 million population) and the Russian Federation (3917 new deaths; 27 new deaths per 1 million population). For the ninth consecutive week, the number of cases and deaths increased in Estonia. Last week, while the number of new cases reported in Estonia increased by 27%, the number of new deaths increased by 18%. The country has reported peaks in new cases and deaths, with the most affected counties being Harju, Ida-Viru and Tartu. The average age of hospitalized cases was 67 years; 69 years for among females and 65 years among males. In response to these increases, public health and social measures were tightened on 14 December. Estonia has conducted over 565000 PCR tests. The case fatality rate (0.8%) remains low, the test positivity rate is relatively high at 11%. In Portugal, following three weeks of a decline in the incidence of cases and deaths, both remained relatively stable in the past week. The number of new cases in the country was highest in Mandim de Basto, Marvao and Chaves counties. As of 20 December, there were 3158 hospitalized cases, of which 502 (16%) are in intensive care unit. The number of new reported deaths in the country was the highest reported since the start of the pandemic. The number of cases in Spain have decreased for the seventh consecutive week, dropping slightly (2%), with a much larger decrease in the number of new deaths (a 44% decrease). The regions with the highest incidence per 100000 population were Palencia (172) and Girona (159), while Palencia also had the highest incidence per 100000 in those aged over 65 years (247). Approximately 20% of intensive care unit beds in the country are occupied by COVID-19 patients.
The Region reported just over 249000 new cases and under 4000 new deaths, 14% and 10% decreases respectively (Figure 7). This continues the declines observed since the middle of September. Only two countries out of ten in the Region reported an increase in new cases (Thailand and Indonesia). India has now reported over 10 million cases, and despite the number of new cases falling by 18% this week, the country reported the fifth highest number of new cases globally (174000 new cases, 126 new cases per 1 million population). In the Region, India was followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal in the number of new cases and new deaths reported last week. Myanmar reported 8300 new cases (150 new cases per 1 million population) last week, an 11% decline from the previous week. Although cases were first reported in Myanmar in March, fewer than 1000 cases were reported by mid-August. The number of weekly new cases started to rise at the end of August and has remained between 6000 and 11000 since the end of September. The townships of Mingaladon, North Okkalapa, Hlaingtharya, and Insein, which are close to the capital, Yangon, have reported the highest numbers of cumulative cases. As of 20 December, 1.6 million PCR tests had been conducted, with a current test positivity rate of 4%. Sri Lanka reported 3900 new cases (180 new cases per 1 million), a 20% decline from last week. Weekly new cases rose considerably in the beginning of October, and new weekly cases have remained between 2500 and 5000 since the end of October. The number of deaths due to COVID-19 has remained low, with a current case fatality rate of 0.5%. As of 13 December, 1 million PCR tests have been conducted, with a current positivity rate of 4%. Thailand reported 139 new cases last week (2 new cases per 1 million population), a 16% increase from the previous reporting period. Thailand has been successful at keeping the number of new cases below 100 per week from the end of April to early November. However, since the week of 9 November, the number of new weekly cases has risen steadily. A new outbreak in Samut Sakhon province was reported on 21 December, and accounts for a considerable proportion of the number of new cases. There have been no new deaths reported since 2 November. As of 6 December, 1.3 million PCR tests have been conducted, with a test positivity rate of 0.3%.
The numbers of new cases and deaths reported in the Western Pacific Region have been increasing consistently but gradually over the past seven weeks. New weekly cases increased by 3% in the past week (Figure 8). The Region continues to report the lowest number of new cases compared to other regions, with 46662 new cases and 636 deaths reported. Japan continued to report the highest number of new cases and deaths (18593 and 311 respectively), followed by Malaysia (9723 new cases, 22 new deaths), Philippines (9713 new cases, 181 new deaths) and the Republic of Korea (6899 new cases, 94 new deaths). The Republic of Korea reported 94 deaths, a 169% increase in new weekly deaths compared to the previous week with 35 deaths. Due to the increasing number of new cases since November 2020, the Seoul metropolitan area is facing challenges in the availability of critical care beds, with 580 patients waiting for beds in Seoul as of 18 December, of which nearly half have been waiting for at least two days. In response to the continued rise in number of new cases, the government toughened preventive measures in Seoul to Level 2.5, the second highest level under the five-tier system. In the past week, Singapore reported the highest increase (55%) in new weekly cases in the region. While the country reported 90 new cases last week, all were imported and had been issued stay-at-home notices or were isolated on arrival, preventing further transmission in the community. The country will be moving from Phase 2 to Phase 3 of its reopening starting 28 December 2020, allowing gatherings of eight people ahead of the new year. Singapore approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and announced that they expect to have enough for the whole country by the third quarter of 2021.
Globally in the past week, over 4 million new cases were reported. Although this is a 12% decrease compared to the previous week, this and other short-term trends in data should be interpreted with caution over the end-of-year holiday season, as numbers may be influenced by presentation, testing and reporting delays. New deaths decreased by 8% to 72730 (Figure 1, Table 1). The Region of the Americas accounts for 48% of all new cases and 42% of all new deaths globally. While new cases and deaths remained high in the European Region, which accounted for 37% and 42% respectively, both decreased compared to the previous week. New cases and deaths declined in South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the African Region, while both new cases and deaths remained low compared to other regions, there was a 20% increase in new cases and 37% in new deaths. In the Western Pacific Region, new cases increased by 13% and new deaths increased by 4%. As of 27 December there have been over 79.2 million cases and over 1.7 million deaths reported since the start of the pandemic. A variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in South Africa through retrospective genomic analyses of the virus. Initial analysis indicates that the variant, known as 501Y.V2, may spread more readily between people. Investigations are ongoing to determine if it is associated with any change in the severity of infection, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (with over 1.3 million cases, a 19% decrease from the previous week), Brazil (over 285000 cases, a 12% decrease), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (over 251000 cases, a 45% increase), Russian Federation (over 201000 cases, a 3% increase) and India (over 156000 cases, a 10% decrease).
In the past week, over 114000 new cases were reported in the African Region, a 20% increase compared to the previous week, and over 2500 deaths, a 37% increase over the previous week. South Africa continues to account for the greatest proportion (72%) of new weekly cases in the Region. In the past week, the highest number of new cases were reported from South Africa (82434 new cases; 1390 new cases per 1 million population), Nigeria (5643 new cases; 27 new cases per 1 million), Algeria (3076 new cases, 70 new cases per 1 million) and Namibia (2961 new cases, 1165 new cases per 1 million).

In the Region of the Americas, the number of new weekly cases was over 1965000 and 31142 new deaths, which represent 15% and 3% decreases over the previous week, respectively. The United States of America accounted for 68% of all new cases in the Region. The highest new case and deaths counts were reported in the United States of America (1334155 new cases, 4031 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (285582 new cases; 1344 new cases per 1 million) and Colombia (92635 new cases, 1821 new cases per 1 million). The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the United States of America (16864 new deaths; 51 new deaths per 1 million), Brazil (2838 new deaths; 23 new deaths per 1 million) and Mexico (4588 new deaths; 36 new deaths per 1 million).
The Eastern Mediterranean Region reported over 157000 new cases and over 3400 new deaths, reflecting a reduction of 9% and 10%, respectively compared to the previous week. Cases and deaths in the Region decreased for the fifth consecutive week. The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (42891 new cases, 511 new cases per 1 million), Morocco (15336 new cases, 415 new cases per 1 million) and Pakistan (14809 new cases, 67 new cases per 1 million). These three countries accounted for the most new cases in the previous two weeks. The highest number of new deaths were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (1126 new deaths; 13 new deaths per 1 million), Pakistan (566 new deaths; 3 new deaths per 1 million) and Tunisia (300 new deaths; 25 new deaths per 1 million).
The number of new cases in the European Region remains high with over 1.5 million reported in the past week. However, the number of new cases has declined over the past week, decreasing by 12%, while deaths decreased by 15% to 31000 new deaths. Despite the observed reductions, the European Region continues to account for the second highest number of new cases and deaths globally (37% and 42% respectively). Last week, the countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (251786 new cases, 3709 new cases per 1 million), the Russian Federation (201871 new cases; 1383 new cases per 1 million population) and Germany (146849 new cases; 1753 new cases per 1 million). The highest number of deaths were reported from the same countries, namely Russian Federation (3920 new deaths; 27 new deaths per 1 million), Germany (3729 new deaths; 45 new deaths per 1 million) and the United Kingdom (3330 new deaths; 49 new deaths per 1 million).
In the South-East Asia Region, nearly 232000 new cases were reported last week, a decrease of 6% compared to the previous week, while new deaths were nearly 4000, a slight decrease of 1%. There has been an overall decline in both cases and deaths since the peak in the week beginning 7 September. The countries reporting the highest number of both new cases and new deaths in the past week were India (156627 new cases; 113 new cases per 1 million; 2145 new deaths; 2 new deaths per 1 million), Indonesia (48889 new cases; 179 new cases per 1 million; 1335 new deaths; 5 new deaths per 1 million) and Bangladesh (8539 new cases; 52 new cases per 1 million; 186 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million).
In the Western Pacific Region, new cases (13%) and deaths (4%) continued to increase, a trend which has been seen over the past eight weeks. The Region reported over 53000 new cases and nearly 700 new deaths. The highest new cases were reported in Japan (21432 new cases; 169 new cases per 1 million), Malaysia (11931 new cases; 369 new cases per 1 million) and the Philippines (10961 new cases; 100 new cases per 1 million). The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths this week were Japan (340 new deaths; 3 new deaths per 1 million), the Philippines (156 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million) and the Republic of Korea (134 new deaths; 3 new deaths per 1 million).
For the third week in a row over 4 million new cases were reported globally, although this week saw a slight decrease compared to the previous week. However, this and other short-term trends in data should be interpreted with caution owing to the end-of-year holiday season, as numbers may be influenced by presentation, testing and reporting delays. The decrease seen last week in new deaths has been reversed with deaths rising by 3% to 76000 (Figure 1, Table 1). The Region of the Americas accounted for 47% of all new cases and 42% of all new deaths globally in the past week. New cases and deaths remained high in the European Region, which accounted for 38% and 43% respectively, showing a slight decrease in new cases and a slight increase in new deaths. New cases and deaths continue to decline in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions. In the African Region, while both new cases and deaths remain low in absolute numbers, for the fourth week in a row, the Region is reporting the largest percentage increase globally in weekly reported case numbers and this week there was a further 13% increase in new cases and 28% increase in new deaths. In the Western Pacific Region, new cases remained comparable to the previous week, but new deaths rose by 10%. As we welcome the New Year, and look eagerly towards COVID-19 vaccination campaigns worldwide, the current epidemiological situation with near record numbers of new cases and deaths, makes it imperative to continue to adhere to safety measures to prevent further transmission and loss of life. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (with 1325424 cases, just under a third of global cases and unchanged from last week), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (343784 cases, continuing last week’s rapid increase with a 36% increase), Brazil (252018 cases, an 11% decrease), the Russian Federation (186539 cases, a 7% decrease) and India (136115 cases, a 13% decrease).
In the past week, over 130000 new cases were reported in the African Region, a 13% increase compared to the previous week, and over 3000 deaths, a 4% increase over the previous week.

The highest new case counts were reported in the United States of America (1325424 new cases, 4004 new cases per 1 million), Brazil (252018 new cases; 1186 new cases per 1 million) and Colombia (80173 new cases, 1576 new cases per 1 million). The highest numbers of new deaths were reported from the United States of America (17239 new deaths; 52 new deaths per 1 million), Brazil (4923 new deaths; 23 new deaths per 1 million) and Mexico (4670 new deaths; 36 new deaths per 1 million).
In the past week, the Eastern Mediterranean Region reported over 154000 new cases and over 3000 new deaths, a decrease of 1% and 12%, respectively compared to the previous week. Cases and deaths in the Region decreased for the sixth consecutive week. The highest number of new cases were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (42511 new cases, 506 new cases per 1 million), Lebanon (16936 new cases, 2841 new cases per 1 million) and Pakistan (14880 new cases, 67 new cases per 1 million). These three countries accounted for almost half (48%) of new weekly cases in the Region. The highest number of new deaths were reported from the Islamic Republic of Iran (864 new deaths; 10 new deaths per 1 million), Pakistan (442 new deaths; 2 new deaths per 1 million) and Egypt (389 new deaths; 4 new deaths per 1 million).
The European Region continues to report a large number of cases with over 1.5 million new cases and 3200 new deaths, a 3% decrease and 2% increase compared to the previous week, respectively. New weekly cases have decreased for the past two weeks. The Region reported the highest proportion (43%) of global new deaths among all regions. Last week, the countries reporting the highest number of new cases were the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (343784 new cases, 5064 new cases per 1 million), the Russian Federation (186539 new cases; 1278 new cases per 1 million) and Germany (124808 new cases; 1490 new cases per 1 million). The highest number of deaths were reported from Germany (4494 new deaths; 54 new deaths per 1 million), the United Kingdom (4165 new deaths; 61 new deaths per 1 million) and the Russian Federation (3728 new deaths; 26 new deaths per 1 million).
New cases and deaths in the South-East Region have continued to decrease, a trend observed since early September. Just over 200000 new cases and 3700 new deaths were reported this week, a 10% and 3% decrease respectively, compared to the previous week. The three countries reporting the highest number of new cases and new deaths were India (136115 new cases; 99 new cases per 1 million; 1813 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million), Indonesia (51636 new cases; 189 new cases per 1 million; 1561 new deaths; 6 new deaths per 1 million) and Bangladesh (7085 new cases; 43 new cases per 1 million; 171 new deaths; 1 new death per 1 million). India has consistently reported the highest number of new cases and deaths since the end of the first week of April 2020.
In the past week, there has been little change in the number of new cases (just under 53000) reported in the Western Pacific Region, while new deaths increased by 10% (over 700) compared to the previous week. The plateau in new cases over the past week comes after four weeks of increasing trends. The three countries reporting the highest number of new cases this week were Japan (23642 new cases; 187 new cases per 1 million), Malaysia (13473 new cases; 416 new cases per 1 million) and Philippines (7911 new cases; 72 new cases per 1 million).

Following two weeks of low reporting, likely due to the year-end holiday period, the overall upward trend seen in earlier weeks has resumed, with just under 5 million new cases reported last week globally. The number of new deaths has also shown a similar trend, with over 85000 reported last week, an 11% increase (Figure 1, Table 1). All regions apart from South-East Asia showed an increase in new cases, with the Western Pacific, Africa and the Americas reporting increases of over 30%. The Region of the Americas accounted for 51% of all new cases and 45% of all new deaths globally in the past week. The European Region had a lower increase in new cases (10%), however still accounts for over a third of new cases globally. In South-East Asia, the decline in new cases and new deaths seen since the end of November 2020 continues. Although the Eastern Mediterranean Region is showing an 11% increase in new cases, new deaths have fallen by 9%, continuing a downward trend since a peak in mid-November. The African Region reported 175000 new cases and 4300 new deaths, an increase of over 30% in new cases and new deaths, far exceeding previous peaks in July 2020. The Western Pacific also reported an increase of more than 30% in new cases, while the number of new deaths also rose by 14%. In the past week, the five countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (with 1786773 cases, a 35% increase), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (417620 cases, a 22% increase), Brazil (313130 cases, a 24% increase), the Russian Federation (165167 cases, continuing last week’s decrease with an 12% decrease) and Germany (142861 cases, reversing last week’s decrease with a 15% increase).
In the past week, the African Region reported the highest percentage increases in both cases and deaths compared to the previous week. Over 174000 new cases and over 4300 deaths were reported, increases of 34% and 31% respectively. Cases in the Region have been increasing since mid-September 2020 but steeper increases have been observed since late November. The highest numbers of new cases were reported in South Africa (125287 new cases; 211.2 new cases per 100000 population; a 27% increase), Nigeria (8315 new cases; 4.0 new cases per 100000; a 49% increase) and Zimbabwe (6008 new cases; 40.4 new cases per 100000; a 293% increase).

At the same time, the number of new deaths has climbed to a record high at 93000, a 9% increase from last week. Over 2 million people have now lost their lives to COVID-19. The Americas, Europe, and South-East Asia regions showed declines in new cases, with Europe showing a 15% decline and the Americas and South-East Asia regions showing more moderate declines of 2% and 1% respectively (Table 1). On the other hand, the Eastern Mediterranean, African, and Western Pacific regions reported increases in new cases, with the Western Pacific showing the largest increase (14%). All regions reported increases in new deaths; case incidence continues to be one of the primary drivers of mortality – where increases in the number of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and deaths follow large numbers of cases after a short time lag.

Over 2.6 million new cases were reported last week, a 7% increase compared to the previous week, following six consecutive weeks of declining numbers (Figure 1). The global case increase was driven by increases in the Eastern Mediterranean (14%), South-East Asia (9%), Europe (9%) and the Americas (6%). Possible reasons for this increase include the continued spread of more transmissible variants of concern (VOCs), relaxation of public health and social measures (PHSM) and fatigue around adhering to PSHM measures. Basic public health measures remain the foundation of the response. For public health authorities, that means testing, contact tracing, isolation, supported quarantine and quality care. For individuals, it means avoiding crowds, physical distancing, hand hygiene, masks and ventilation. Furthermore, immunity conferred by vaccination takes weeks at the individual level, and it may take longer to observe impacts at the population-level. The number of global new deaths continues to decrease, with over 63000 new deaths reported last week, a 6% decrease as compared to the previous week. New deaths decreased in four regions, Europe, Africa the Western Pacific, and the Americas (by 15%, 19%, 35% and 1%, respectively), and increased by 47% in the South East Asia Region, partly due to retrospective reporting of deaths from Nepal.
